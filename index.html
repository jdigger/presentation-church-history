<div class="paragraph"><p>Every one of the key points of dispute is based upon the Catholic Church&#8217;s use of the &#8220;extra-Biblical&#8221; Cannon Law</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Put simply: If <em>Sola Scriptura</em> is correct, then the Catholic Church (of Luther&#8217;s time and beyond) is fundamentally wrong and deeply heretical, and if it&#8217;s wrong then the same applies to the Protestants</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>By Catholic doctrine, there are two sources of &#8220;special&#8221; revelation: Scripture and Cannon Law. Catholic doctrine states that Cannon Law isn&#8217;t so much &#8220;another source&#8221; as it is a guide and extension to what the Bible says; complimenting the words of Scripture with further revelation that God has graced His Church with. Since the best interpreter of Scripture is God himself, God has promised to guide and protect His Church, and the Church is the embodiment of Christ&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;through the constant intercession of the Holy Spirit&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;on the earth, therefore the Church has been given the ability to know the mind of God and His Word to whatever degree God chooses. (Which is all a long way of saying that God makes a stronger guarantee that His Church as a whole would know His will than any one person would since many of His promises about it are &#8220;corporate&#8221; promises.)  The Lord has given His Church many good and faithful leaders to help the Church grow, and we ignore the wisdom He granted them at our peril. Finally, to help clarify parts of the Bible, and to speak to issues on which the Bible is silent, God has guided His Church over the years to know that which had previously been hidden, which He does through Papal and Council edicts on doctrine.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Protestant doctrine regarding &#8220;special revelation&#8221; says there is only one source: Scripture. (Hence &#8220;Sola Scriptura.&#8221;) While the Magisterial Reformers agreed entirely about the value of the wisdom and insight of those that lead the way, Sola Scriptura says that Scripture is sufficient for the Christian Life. But that&#8217;s a little misleading&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a better description comes from one of the Magisterial Reformers, John Calvin: &#8220;Where Scripture is silent I must not speak.&#8221;  Sola Scriptura means that we can never say any more or less than Scripture itself says. The Church is given the job of protecting the integrity of the Word, and should therefore endeavor to understand it and never to distort or &#8220;extend&#8221; it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Purgatory is never mentioned in the Bible, though a lot speaks against it. However, Canon Law very explicitly states that it is real. The veneration/worship of Mary is never encouraged in the Bible, but Cannon Law and tradition mandate it in virtually every major part of Catholic life. The concept of mortal vs. venial (non-damning) sins is a distinction that the Bible lampoons, but it&#8217;s fundamental to a Catholic understanding of sin. Meritorious works (works that merit you going to Heaven) are denounced in the strongest possible language in the Bible&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;only Christ accomplished &#8220;meritorious works&#8221;&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but it is basic to the Catholic doctrine of Sanctification. Some other examples are papal authority and saintly intercession.</p></div></aside></section></section>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The reasons reform was impossible, he said, was:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>the Papacy had subjugated temporal powers to itself</p></li><li><p>Councils could not act as a check to the abuses of the Pope</p></li><li><p>nobody else was allowed to show the Papacy where it had erred since it alone could interpret Scripture</p></li></ul></div></section><section id="_nobles_are_leaders_of_their_people"><h2>Nobles Are Leaders of Their People</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>The language is harsh and inflammatory, urging the nobility in very flattering terms to respond in a way that is their duty both as Christians and leaders of their people</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This is where he described the doctrine of the Priesthood of All Believers</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>As we talked about before, there has long been a growing tension between the power and influence of the Rome and the secular leaders. This was especially true in countries like Germany that had to pay tributes and the like to Rome, but got little in the way of the benefits from such subordination.

<div class="paragraph"><p>By both Catholic and Lutheran doctrine, a Sacrament is a sacred act mandated by Christ in which He offers, gives and seals to us the forgiveness of sins</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The reduction from seven to two is because he asserts that it&#8217;s only the Lord&#8217;s Supper and Baptism for which those qualifications are clearly met in the Bible</p></div></section><section id="_sacrament_of_penance"><h2>Sacrament of Penance</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>The &#8220;and a half&#8221; is because he&#8217;s rather ambiguous at this point about Penance; at times hinting that it should be a Sacrament, at times hinting that it shouldn&#8217;t be</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This was caused primarily because while he had worked out that Penance is not a Sacrament by the time he finished the work, his works were such a hot commodity that the publishers wouldn&#8217;t even let the ink dry before grabbing it from him, much less allowing him such &#8220;luxuries&#8221; as editing and revisions</p></div></section><section id="_the_freedom_of_the_christian"><h2>The Freedom of the Christian</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>Written in both Latin and German, this was his first major clear statement on his views regarding Justification: namely Sola Gratia (By Grace Alone) and Sola Fide (By Faith Alone)</p></div>
