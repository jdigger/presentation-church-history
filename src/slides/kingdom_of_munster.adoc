== The Kingdom of Münster: Anabaptism Gone Very Bad

image::542878559.jpg[]

=== Melchior Hoffman

Melchior Hoffman started as an idiosyncratic follower of Luther, but over the course of a few years diverged further and further until there was very little in common

In 1530 he was kicked out of Strasbourg for his radicalism and went to Emden (in northern Germany, right next to the Netherlands)

There he proclaimed that the Apocalypse would occur in 1533 and that Strasbourg would be the New Jerusalem

=== Magisterial Power of the Sword

Righteous magistrates to whom God had given the holy "`power of the sword`" would use that prerogative to exterminate the godless living in Strasbourg

The 144,000 talked about in Revelation would be people that had received adult baptism; they would not participate in the slaughter, but would give their moral support by praying for the efforts of the magistrates in destroying the ungodly

[.small]
--
(Therefore Hoffman and his followers technically were pacifists because they would not participate in the violence themselves)
--

=== Responding To Anabaptist Persecution

Hoffman gained a handful of adherents in Emden, who then went to surrounding towns and cities, making more converts of Melchiorite Anabaptists

After the execution of some Anabaptists in December of 1531, Hoffman called for a moratorium on new adult baptisms for two years

=== Rotham Converts Münster

Meanwhile, in the Northern German city of Münster, Bernhard Rothman led the charge in making the city Lutheran, and succeeded in making the city government Lutheran by early 1533

During the summer of 1533, though, Rothman became a Zwinglian while the magistrates remained staunchly Lutheran

=== Time Is Running Out

Back in Emden, by November of 1533 time was running out for the Melchiorite Anabaptists before the end of the world would happen

With this growing sense of urgency looming over them, Jan Matthijs over-ruled Hoffman's ban on baptisms and sent apostles out to win more converts and perform more baptisms, including into Münster

December 31st came and went and, strangely, the End had not happened

=== Lax In Removing the Godless

According to Matthijs, Hoffman had not been wrong -- God hadn't come because the godly had been lax in their duties, not doing enough to prepare the way for Christ's return

Clearly what was needed was for them to stop merely praying for the removal of the godless from the earth, relying upon magistrates who obviously were not righteous enough to do their duty

Rather they must actively carry out God's judgment on the world themselves

=== God Will Judge the World From Münster

As the apostles sent by Matthijs had won the most converts in Münster, Matthijs prophesized that it would be in Münster that the elect would be saved

--
(Hoffman, by this point, is in a Strasbourg jail, where he dies ten years later)
--

On Easter of 1534, according to the prophesy, God would judge the world from Münster

This causes a large influx of Anabaptists into the city of Münster so they can be there to be saved

=== The Residents of Münster Leave

Between the factional disputes between the Lutherans and Zwinglians, and the rapidly growing numbers Anabaptists, many of the residents of Münster see that trouble is brewing

=== Leaving An Anchor

Figuring that it will be just a temporary period of instability, many of the men leave, hoping to find better prospects elsewhere and ride out the storm

They leave their wives/sisters/daughters/mothers/etc. in Münster because they want to return again as soon as it's all over

One of the few legal rights a woman had was that it was illegal to take her property

[.small]
--
(Besides, women were highly unlikely to get caught in the middle of whatever was going down, so they figured they would be relatively safe. No one would be so vile as to threaten them...)
--

The men would continue to earn a living and return when things calmed down, pay off any debts his family had accrued while he was gone, and life would return to normal

=== Control of the Government Changes

With so many of the native men gone, control of the government passes to the only large group of men left in the city -- the Anabaptists, with Matthijs at the head

=== The Siege Starts

The local prince-bishop, seeing how bad the situation had become, laid siege to the city within days of the Anabaptist takeover

Both sides agree to allow anybody left in the city that was not an Anabaptist to leave, meaning that the city was now entirely comprised of Anabaptists

Or, as they preferred to refer to themselves, the "`New Jerusalem`" was now filled only with "`Israelites`"

=== Abolishment of Private Property

Matthijs then declared for an abolishment of private property: the property of anyone that had left was confiscated, money was declared worthless, and food was pooled to be able to deal with the Anabaptist immigrants (who of course hadn't come with anything since the world was going to end soon anyway) and to deal with the siege

[.small]
--
(A house, for example, could be "`your house,`" but you couldn't lock your doors, so anybody else that wanted to come in and use what's there had every right to)
--

=== Jan van Leiden: The King of Righteousness

Matthijs was killed in a skirmish with the prince's troops in April of 1534 and was succeeded by Jan van Leiden

Van Leiden had some victories against the prince's army and was declared "`The King of Righteousness`" and "`The Ruler of the New Zion`"

His word was equivalent to God's, and any resistance to his sacred power was ruthlessly punished

=== Polygamy

The "`Ruler of the New Zion`" immediately decided to reinstate an Old Testament practice: polygamy

=== Needing More

This solved several problems for him:

. he was already married, but he wanted to also marry the beautiful widow of Jan Matthijs
. the extraordinary imbalance in the gender demographics: in a city of about eight thousand, there were approximately three times as many women as there were men
. they were well short of the 144,000 needed for the Apocalypse, so he hoped that doing this would maximize procreation

How they were going to go from 8,000 to 144,000 in a couple of months through sex was not made particularly clear, and raising the question was blasphemy
--

=== Polygamy Dissent

A lot of people in Münster recognize that this was going way too far, but any men that complained were executed and women were imprisoned

In fact, to really drive the point home to everyone, when one of van Leiden's fifteen wives complains, he beheads her in the town square and has his horse trample her body

=== Righteous Apostles

Over the course of the next year, van Leiden sends apostles out to other cities to try to make the movement grow beyond the borders of Münster

There are rebellions in some of those cities, but they are quickly crushed

=== God Is Not Going To Save Them

By spring of 1535, the Anabaptists in Münster are extremely disheartened and resign themselves to the fact that things are not going to happen as they hoped

In June of 1535 the bishop's army finally conquered the city

Almost everyone that was still alive in the city was either gravely sick or dying of starvation, and the army quickly relieved them of such worldly concerns

The leaders were gathered up, executed, and their bodies were put in steel cages hung high as a reminder of what had happened

=== If The Peasant's War Was Bad...

The events at Münster were a scandal of the highest order

Any doubts remaining in people's minds about the dangers of radical religious views after the Peasant's War were dispelled, including the "`truth`" of Anabaptist claims of peace

Any rulers that had since started to moderate their persecution during the ten years between the war and Münster now redoubled their efforts
