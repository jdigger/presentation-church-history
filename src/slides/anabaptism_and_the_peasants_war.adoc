== Anabaptism and the Peasant's War

image::spanishsoldiersexecPROT1567.jpg[]

=== Anabaptist Sympathies

As can be seen by the dates, the start and growth of Anabaptism coincided with the Peasants War

The Anabaptists had extremely strong sympathies with the peasants fighting the war

While the pacifism of the Anabaptists prevented them from actually taking up arms, many groups helped provision and otherwise aid the people fighting

=== Society Rejects the Gospel

The utter destruction of the Peasant's War was a huge setback for the Anabaptists as well

From a morale stand-point, they saw society's rejection of the ideals of the war as a rejection of the Gospel that the peasants had been fighting for

=== Rejecting the Fallen World

If the rest of the world was so dead-set against living as true Christians, then true Christians should reject the rest of the world

=== Jesus Had Warned Against the World

That society couldn't be remade along the lines of love and justice didn't mean that doing so was wrong, but rather that the world could not accept such truth -- which was exactly what Jesus had promised his disciples

=== Giving Up On the World

Such rejection meant was that they should continue to try to live pure lives, but no longer attempt to make the rest of the world do so

=== Separating From The World

Therefore they started separatist communities of committed Christians, dedicated to live holy lives free from the corruption of the ungodly

In this way they continued the spirit of the Peasant's War, but on a much smaller scale

=== The Schleitheim Articles

In February of 1527, Michael Sattler (a former Benedictine monk) and others put together for the Swiss Brethren https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleitheim_Confession[the Schleitheim Articles]

In addition to other things, the seven short articles rejected established political institutions and the very possibility that they could ever be reformed to be Christian

=== No Oaths

In addition to meaning that "`real`" Christians could not possibly serve in the government, it also meant that Christians can not give oaths to the government

=== No Oaths of Fidelity or Veracity

A Christian can not, therefore, take an oath of loyalty to his lord, or even swear before a court an oath to tell the truth

This, as you can imagine, did not ease the fears of the authorities at all

=== Life Gets Harder

Unsurprisingly, the Anabaptists had an even harder time after the Peasant's War

Because they clearly had radical social and religious views, authorities clamped down **_hard_**

=== Lack of Trust

With the ways in which the Anabaptists were spurning society's rules and authority, just like the people had done for the Peasant's War, could authorities really trust that the Anabaptists truly were the pacifists they claimed to be?

Could they believe that the separatist communities that they created for themselves were benign rather than cauldrons of conspiracy and rebellion?

=== Fear Bringing Martyrdom

Between 1525 and 1535, in addition to severe persecution, several hundred Anabaptists were executed in Germanic lands for their beliefs by authorities terrified of what had happened in the Peasant's War

Such persecution fueled the feelings of martyrdom and "`bearing the cross for Christ`" that the Anabaptists felt, causing them to withdraw even further from the world

=== Swiss Brethren In the US

Direct descendants of the Swiss Brethren live in modern America: the Amish

The Amish continue to have a strong distrust of secular government and refuse to be reliant upon it

=== Taking Up Müntzer's Cause

In South Germany and Austria, leaders like Hans Hut took up the mantle of Müntzer

=== Fleeing East

People fleeing the persecution went east, to Bohemia and Moravia (modern Czech Republic), where the persecution was much less

Jacob Hutter gathered these refugees -- even helping them escape Austria to get to the safety of Moravia -- and formed a communitarian society of Anabaptists called the Hutterites

=== Hutterites

What really set them apart was that they abolished private property within their community, modeling themselves after the early Christians described in the book of Acts (particularly the 2nd and 4th chapters)

This was extremely controversial, not only among non-Anabaptists, but also among other Anabaptist groups

=== Hutterites In North America

Like the Swiss Brethren, there are substantial Hutterite groups in modern North America

While most started out in the United States' Northern Great Plains, most had to flee to Canada because of persecution for their pacifism during World War I
