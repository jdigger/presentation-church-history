== The Theologian

=== Calvinism

While Martin Luther served as the spark and lightning rod of the Reformation, it is Calvinism -- the theology based upon the writings on John Calvin -- which is by far the most influential strain of Protestantism to come out of the Reformation

In fact, what we refer to today as "`Reformed Theology`" is very distinctly Calvinist

=== Bringing It All Together

Catholicism had Thomas Aquinas`' "`_Summa Theologiae_`" as a comprehensive work showing how all the principle doctrines of the Faith build upon and support each other

Even with Luther's prolific writings and catechisms, there was nothing approaching that for the developing Protestant faiths

That would now change...

=== Puritans and Presbyterians

In the American church, the denomination that is most directly descended from him is Presbyterianism (by way of the Puritans), but the Baptists and many others are branches from that root

=== Legacy As A Theologian

Every Christian denomination in America (including Catholic and Lutheran) has been heavily influenced by his legacy

He became known among his peers (including Luther, who was 26 years his senior and often vehemently in opposition with him) simply as "`The Theologian`"

=== A Scholarly Temperament

While Luther was undeniably brilliant, Calvin was just as clearly more intelligent still -- which would raise the largest criticisms against him for relying too much on human reasoning

As we'll see, this was both fair and not

He also tended to rely (too much?) on the strength of his arguments over polemics, which continues to manifest in a relatively "`intellectual`" religious profession by those that follow him more closely

=== Legal Education

Born in 1509 just outside of Paris, his father arranged for him to get a clerical benefice at the age of twelve, which helped pay for his education

Intellectually ravenous and gifted, he learned both the Scholastic and Humanistic methods under some of the best professors at the University of Paris, and earned his master's degree at the age of 18

=== Earning His Doctorate

Humanism greatly influenced him, and his first published work was on one of Seneca's writings (the famous Roman philosopher and politician)

At the age of 22 he has earned his doctorate in law, having studied in Orleans and Bourges

=== Calvin Becomes A Protestant

Around the beginning of 1534, Calvin was converted from being a Catholic to a Protestant

He renounced his benefice as being inconsistent with his new faith, and flees the country

The Affair of the Placards was the same year, so he really didn't have much choice in the matter...

=== Exile

Throughout his life, being an exile plays an enormous part in his thought, and he greatly identified with that theme all through the Bible

=== Understanding Exile

This serves him well as a reformer, as it helps him relate well to the refuges of the persecution of Protests in Europe

It gives him an international tone that's completely lacking in Luther (who's German to the core and then some)

=== Detour To Geneva

On his way to the city of Strasbourg in the summer of 1536 to continue a life of scholarship, Calvin had to take a detour to the newly Protestant city of Geneva

Farel, who's been leading the reformation in Geneva after leaving Meaux, urged Calvin to stay

=== Scholar Not Reformer

Calvin kept insisting that he's a scholar, not some kind of religious leader fit for leading a city reformation, but Farel insists that God has much bigger plans for him and therefore it's Calvin's duty before God to stay

Calvin finally relents and, at the age of 27, becomes co-head of the city's reformation

=== Overzealous

Calvin and Farel had no real experience in this kind of thing, and tried to do too much too fast

They were denounced for meddling in the governmental and moral life of the city, and exiled from Geneva less than two years after Calvin had gotten there in the first place

=== Exiled from Exile

Exiled from his place of exile, he finally made it to Strasbourg

=== A Student of Strasbourg

There Calvin was able to experience a successful city reformation and learn under the tutelage of its reformers, who also show him how to relate to and negotiate with Catholics and other Protestant groups

It is also in Strasbourg that he gets his experience as a pastor, shepherding the French-speaking refuges

In addition to all that, he continues his scholarship and writings, producing some major works, and even manages to get married

=== Called Back to Geneva

In early 1540, after only two years in Strasbourg, he was called back to Geneva

While he had been gone, the religious and political situation in Geneva had become unstable, and he was being begged to come back

After more than a year of debating about it with himself, he finally relented, feeling that it was his duty to do what God was clearly calling him for

=== Learned How To Lead A Reformation

He has learned from his mistakes, and this time he does things like being extremely careful to keep church and state separate (though they were to work closely together)

This time, he's not going anywhere, and he will lead Geneva's religious life until his death in 1564
