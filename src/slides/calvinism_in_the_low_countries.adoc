== The Growth of Calvinism in the Low Countries

=== Charles' Persecution of Heresy

Between 1523 and 1566 -- the principle years of the Charles V's Inquisition in the Low Countries -- about 1,300 had been executed for heresy

=== The Vile Charles V

Remember that the dispute was over **_WHAT_** to put down, not **_HOW_** or **_IF_**

Emperor Charles often gets vilified, but while he certainly wasn't a pacifist, nothing he did was "`out of line`"

=== Emperors Then and Now

Execution, torture and war have always been significant tools for keeping order

Emperor Charles V had a lot more in common with the attitudes and approaches of President Bush/Obama than with Emperor Palpatine...

=== Can Not Stamp It Out

By 1546, there were small secret groups of Calvinists and Anabaptists still in the Low Countries, but Lutherans had become effectively extinct

Even with this level of persecution, as noted before, Charles just couldn't put an end to Protestantism

=== Charles`' Heavy Handedness

In addition to the Inquisition causing a lot of social "`disturbance,`" Charles`' heavy-handedness was very off-putting for the local nobles

=== Better To Turn A Blind Eye

He trampled on many of the ancient rights of the nobles

All confiscated property was turned over to the Empire instead of the local magistrates

It was often in the local ruler's self-interest to simply look the other way when he learned of Protestants in his land

=== Emden

The north German town of Emden had long acted as a refuge (including, to their dismay, for Melchior Hoffman), and by the time of Mary I in England, had grown into a kind of "`Geneva of the North`"

It is to Emden that people would run in Northern Europe when persecution would get too bad at home

Both it and London (once Elizabeth comes to power there) act as the primary sources of Protestant training and refuge during the inquisitions in the Low Countries

=== Fighting Back

By the early 1560's, the Protestants started fighting back

The were prison rescues of those convicted of heresy, incidents of iconoclasm, and open preaching (usually surrounded by armed men to fight off the authorities and threats from the mob)

The Calvinists in London and other places urge those in the Low Lands to not use violence, echoing Calvin's pleas

They were however, for all intents and purposes, ignored

=== Charles V Retires

About the same time, Charles V abdicated his throne and retired to a Spanish monastery

A loyal Catholic, he was a very capable and pragmatic regent that was much more conciliatory than many of those around him

His younger brother, Ferdinand I, served as his regent and representative in the more eastern parts of the Empire. He was even more tolerant than Charles, helping broker many of the attempts at reconciliation, though of course in the end he was unsuccessful

=== Philip II

While his brother-in-law, Maximilian II, would have the title of Holy Roman Emperor, Philip is the one that truly was an emperor

He would hold many titles: King of Spain, King of Portugal, King of Naples, King of Sicily, Duke of Milan, King of England and Ireland (by way of his marriage to Mary I), and lord of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands

He led Spain's "`Golden Age,`" holding territories on every continent known to the Europeans, including his name-sake islands, the Philippine Islands

Though his most famous defeat was leading the Spanish Armada against his late-wife's successor, in virtually everything else he was enormously successful

=== Philip II Is Even More Zealous

The local nobility pleaded all the way to Philip II to moderate the heresy laws

Imposing Catholicism by force had become so disruptive that their country was falling apart

Philip absolutely refused, saying "`Before suffering the slightest damage to religion in the service of God, I would lose all of my estates and a hundred lives, if I had them, because I do not wish nor do I desire to be the ruler of heretics.`"

=== Rehoboam

Whereas Charles was willing to give the local magistrates some discretion in dealing with heresy, Philips insisted on not only enforcing the anti-heresy laws, but being especially harsh about it to make an example

=== The Compromise of the Nobility of 1566

It got to the point that the nobles couldn't deal with it any more

Margaret of Parma, the local regent that was just as zealous as Philip, didn't have much choice in the matter and was forced to accept the Compromise of the Nobility in April of 1566

The anti-heretic laws are abolished and the Inquisition ended

=== The Wonder Year

With the abolishment of the persecution, the "`Wonder Year`" began

A flood of people came back from exile, and there was open-air preaching on an enormous scale: crowds of 20,000 in Ghent and Antwerp, for example

Too much had been repressed for too long, and now that the lid was off things exploded

=== The Iconoclastic Fury

Starting outside a monastery on August 10, the mob -- whipped into a fury over cries of Catholic idolatry -- ransack the monastery, destroying paintings, statues, stained glass, etc.

The chain reaction that followed is known as the Iconoclastic Fury: two months of full-scale iconoclastic destruction all over the Low Countries

=== Starting 80 Years of War

Philip II was **_LIVID_**

He marched his soldiers into the region to punish the heretics for their desecrations of Christ, the Blessed Mother, and all the saints of the Church

This helped initiate 80 years of on-and-off war between Spain and the Netherlands
