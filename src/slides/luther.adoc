=== Wycliffe

image::Jwycliffejmk.jpg[height="400px",alt="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jwycliffejmk.jpg",role="left"]

Wycliffe was a professor of theology at Oxford, England, during the late 14th century

He argued that righteousness alone was reason for power and property, and therefore corrupt clergy and the like were not entitled to such rights

=== Clerical Property

Even more, since Christ and the Apostles didn't have property, neither should those that seek to follow their lead

This didn't go over well with the Bishops, but the Royalty and the people loved it, so they couldn't bring him to trial

=== Wycliffe On the State

He really got in good with the king when he said that the king was Christ's Vicar -- not the Pope -- and the Church should concentrate on spiritual matters and leave the secular matters to the state

Further, not only was the Pope not Christ's Vicar, but he was the Anti-Christ

=== Wycliffe Translates the Bible to English

image::John_Wycliffe_at_work.jpg[role="left",alt="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:John_Wycliffe_at_work.jpg",height="500px"]

He also translated the Vulgate into English so people could read it

The largest Bible translation organization in operation today is called https://www.wycliffe.org/[Wycliffe Bible Translators] in his honor

=== Dealing with Wycliffe

He is credited/blamed for starting the Peasants Revolt of 1381, and died in 1384

image::Wycliffe_bones_Foxe.jpg[alt="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wycliffe_bones_Foxe.jpg",height="400px",role="left"]

The Catholic Church was never able get a hold of him while he lived, but right after he died he was condemned, his body exhumed, and his remains burnt

=== Huss

image::Jan_Hus_2.jpg[role="right",height="400px",alt="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jan_Hus_2.jpg"]

Wycliffe's ideas spread much further east, to Bohemia (modern day Czech Republic), where Huss took many of them up and added that we are saved by grace alone -- not because of meritorious works

This time the Church was able to capture him and convict for heresy

=== Cooking the Goose

image::jan_huss_burned.jpg[alt="http://www.digital-guide.cz/en/realie/chronology-of-prague/14-master-jan-hus-was-burnt-at-the-stake/",role="right"]

As he was standing at the stake to be burned, he said, "`You may cook this goose [a pun -- Huss is very close to the Bohemian word for '`goose`'], but a swan will come to take up the Gospel`"

When Luther rose to prominence almost exactly 100 years after Huss said those words, people immediately made the connection, and he is still identified with the swan in much of Northern and Eastern Europe


== Historical Context

image::349px-Copernicus.jpg[alt="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Copernicus.jpg"]

=== The World Is Not What You Thought...

Copernicus was publishing at the same time as Luther, and Luther commented (disparangingly) on his work

Emperor Charles V has conquistadors conquering the New World and had Magellan circumventing the globe

Leonardo da Vinci died by the time the Reformation got going

=== World Is Turning Inside Out

Advances in archeology, science, literature (Utopia, Shakespeare, The Prince, etc), the growing power and wealth of the middle-class...

This is a time when people are find out that virtually everything they **_knew_** to be true was not, in fact, true

=== Emperor Charles V

image::Titian_-_Portrait_of_Charles_V_Seated_-_WGA22964.jpg[alt="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Titian_-_Portrait_of_Charles_V_Seated_-_WGA22964.jpg"]

=== Territory

image::Empire-Roman-Emperor-Charles-V.jpg[alt="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Empire-Roman-Emperor-Charles-V.jpg"]

This does not include colonial territories...

=== Power Struggle

As should be really obvious from the map, France is an island in a sea of Charles' lands

image::320px-Francois_I_Suleiman.jpg[alt="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Francois_I_Suleiman.jpg"]

This "`encouraged`" France's Francis I to join with the Ottomans...


== Martin Luther

=== Luther as Lawyer

Martin Luther was born in 1483 to a middle-class family, and eventually entered the University of Erfurt to study law

It was there that he was exposed to Humanism and the "`new`" emphasis on going "`back to the sources`"

=== Nominalism

Specifically, he learned the philosophy of Nominalism:

* took a critical attitude toward authority
* drew a fundamental distinction between Man's Reason and God's Word
* taught that all theology be based on the authority of the Bible as interpreted by the Catholic Church
* insisted that all philosophical speculation be tested on the basis of experience and reason

=== The Fruits of Humanism

While at the university, he was exposed to Humanism and was excited about the fruits of Humanism (especially things like Erasmus' Latin translation of the New Testament), but never became a "`Humanist`"

=== Luther as Monk

In 1505 he was caught in a violent storm and called on Saint Anne to spare his life, in return for which he would take monastic vows

He joins the strictest monastic order available: the Observant Augustinians in Erfurt

=== The Chasm of Holiness

While there he was so focused on the chasm between himself and the holiness of God that he would be in confession for hours, confessing sins committed while confessing

He would starve and beat himself so severely that he very nearly died a number of times -- and would have if the other monks hadn't intervened

=== Holiest of All Cities

In 1511 he went to Rome on business for the order, and was shocked at the pervasive blasphemies and ecclesiastical irreverence that this "`holiest of all cities`" nurtured

While further disillusioning him, he remained a devote Catholic

=== Luther as Professor

He obtained his doctorate in 1512 to teach as a professor of Biblical Theology at the University of Wittenberg

He's highly respected within the Augustinian Order, and becomes the "`number two`" man in the order, overseeing ten monasteries and the Augustinians at two universities



== Indulgences

image::Antichrist1.jpg[alt="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Antichrist1.jpg"]

=== Treasury of Merits

The Catholic Church teaches that there is a "`Treasury of Merits`" made up of the excess merit earned by the saints, including Mary and Jesus

By use of the keys given by Christ to Peter, the Church can apply this excess merit to whomever she chooses, which in turn lessens the amount of time that someone would suffer in Purgatory

Rather than merely giving out this merit for nothing, leading to a "`flood of iniquity`" since people would no longer have to be good to go to heaven, the Catholic Church gives it to the penitent sinner as part of his work of satisfaction

=== Apostolic Pardon

The sinner, to show his contrition, can do various things, from going on a Crusade, to making a donation to the Church, to giving up smoking

The Church then, in recognition of the sinner's penance, grants the pardon

== Luther and Indulgences

image::95theses.jpg[]

=== Regarding the Sale of Apostolic Pardon

To help enlist the aid of the other teachers and clergy in protecting the Church from unneeded criticism by the laity for misunderstandings of the doctrine of the Apostolic Pardon (a.k.a., "`Indulgences`"), Luther posted questions for his peers to discuss and sent a copy to the Archbishop of Mainz

His students translated it into German and distributed it widely, to the surprise and dismay of Luther, who wanted to keep it "`in the family`" and only debated among those educated enough to understand the issues

[NOTE.speaker]
--
In 1517, a Dominican by the name of Johann Tetzel was commissioned by Rome through the Archbishop of Mainz to act as its agent in the Wittenberg area to make Indulgences available.  The money raised would be used to build St. Peter's in Rome.  Tetzel, feeling a strong sense of urgency, implored people to be more concerned for their soul than for material things, and came up with a "`jingle`" of "`For every coin that clings [given for an Indulgence], a soul from Purgatory springs.`"  That wasn't what Catholic doctrine taught, but it was "`close enough`" and helped him sell a lot of Indulgences since people interpreted it to mean that they could basically buy their (or a loved one's) way into Heaven.
--

=== No Serious Dispute on the Apostolic Pardon Doctrine

Some examples showing that Luther wasn't trying to overturn Indulgences:

[start=41]
. Apostolic pardons are to be preached with caution, lest the people may falsely think them preferable to other good works of love
. Christians are to be taught that the pope does not intend the buying of pardons to be compared in any way to works of mercy
. Christians are to be taught that he who gives to the poor or lends to the needy does a better work than buying pardons
. Because love grows by works of love, and man becomes better; but by pardons man does not grow better, only more free from penalty



== Pushed To Heretical Territory

image::open-bible.jpg[]

=== Recognizing Sola Scriptura

At the Diet of Augsburg a series of discussions take place -- almost entirely behind closed doors -- asking Luther to recant what he had said

Luther refused to do so unless he could be shown by Scripture, not just from Cannon Law, that he was wrong

What those representatives were doing was trying to show him that the logical conclusion to what Luther was saying was what would become Sola Scriptura, but that had already been declared heretical -- as Luther knew well -- against the likes of John Wycliffe and Jann Huss

=== Opportunity To Remain

His questioners hoped that he would see that he was venturing into territory against God's Church, accepting the Lord's gracious opportunity to remain a beloved child of the Father

Luther could not bring himself to accept their offer

=== Solidifying Sola Scriptura

At the Diet of Augsburg Luther started to understand that he was starting to deny the exclusive power of the Catholic Church to interpret Scripture infallibly, but it was the Leipzig Disputation that cemented this issue for Luther

=== Johannes Eck

Johannes Eck, a young and brilliant representative for Rome who would be Luther's archrival throughout his life, debated Luther and kept pushing Luther farther and farther into a corner

He was pressing Luther into making statements that he really didn't want to say

Eck really showed Luther where his views would take him if he continued on his course

[.small]
Later Luther would thank Eck for doing so; for making him no longer side step some really thorny issues, but to face them full on

=== The Leipzig Debate

It was at Leipzig that Luther finally stated that neither the Pope nor Church Councils has the ability to interpret Scripture perfectly

This caused him a lot of trouble, since it was one thing to do some "`Pope bashing`" -- which was quite popular with the people at the time -- but something else altogether to say that not even the Councils could do it

This was an extremist view that really got people talking...

=== The Source of the Reformation

_Sola Scripture_ is considered the "`source`" doctrine of the Reformation because it's the one from which all the other central issues between the Catholics and Protestants spring

Every one of the key points of dispute is based upon the Catholic Church's use of the "`extra-Biblical`" Cannon Law

Put simply: If _Sola Scriptura_ is correct, then the Catholic Church (of Luther's time and beyond) is fundamentally wrong and deeply heretical, and if it's wrong then the same applies to the Protestants


[NOTE.speaker]
--
By Catholic doctrine, there are two sources of "`special`" revelation: Scripture and Cannon Law. Catholic doctrine states that Cannon Law isn't so much "`another source`" as it is a guide and extension to what the Bible says; complimenting the words of Scripture with further revelation that God has graced His Church with. Since the best interpreter of Scripture is God himself, God has promised to guide and protect His Church, and the Church is the embodiment of Christ -- through the constant intercession of the Holy Spirit -- on the earth, therefore the Church has been given the ability to know the mind of God and His Word to whatever degree God chooses. (Which is all a long way of saying that God makes a stronger guarantee that His Church as a whole would know His will than any one person would since many of His promises about it are "`corporate`" promises.)  The Lord has given His Church many good and faithful leaders to help the Church grow, and we ignore the wisdom He granted them at our peril. Finally, to help clarify parts of the Bible, and to speak to issues on which the Bible is silent, God has guided His Church over the years to know that which had previously been hidden, which He does through Papal and Council edicts on doctrine.

The Protestant doctrine regarding "`special revelation`" says there is only one source: Scripture. (Hence "`Sola Scriptura.`") While the Magisterial Reformers agreed entirely about the value of the wisdom and insight of those that lead the way, Sola Scriptura says that Scripture is sufficient for the Christian Life. But that's a little misleading -- a better description comes from one of the Magisterial Reformers, John Calvin: "`Where Scripture is silent I must not speak.`"  Sola Scriptura means that we can never say any more or less than Scripture itself says. The Church is given the job of protecting the integrity of the Word, and should therefore endeavor to understand it and never to distort or "`extend`" it.

Purgatory is never mentioned in the Bible, though a lot speaks against it. However, Canon Law very explicitly states that it is real. The veneration/worship of Mary is never encouraged in the Bible, but Cannon Law and tradition mandate it in virtually every major part of Catholic life. The concept of mortal vs. venial (non-damning) sins is a distinction that the Bible lampoons, but it's fundamental to a Catholic understanding of sin. Meritorious works (works that merit you going to Heaven) are denounced in the strongest possible language in the Bible -- only Christ accomplished "`meritorious works`" -- but it is basic to the Catholic doctrine of Sanctification. Some other examples are papal authority and saintly intercession.

== Exsurge Domine

image::611px-Life_of_Martin_Luther.jpg[alt="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Life_of_Martin_Luther.jpg"]

=== Luther Is Excommunicated

In 1520, a Papal Bull (an official edict by the Pope) was issued called "`Exsurge Domine`" ("`Arise, Lord`"), calling for Luther to recant, or he and his followers would be excommunicated

Remember, excommunications in those days declared both that you are damned to Hell and that you could be tried and convicted as a heretic

But by this time there was no turning back.

=== Luther Responds to Exsurge Domine

In response to the Bull, Luther published three works to three very different audiences:

* Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation
* The Babylonian Captivity of the Church
* The Freedom of the Christian

=== Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation

Written in German to the nobility of Germany, it urged the nobility to reform the Church in Germany apart from the Catholic Church, since Rome had made reform impossible

The reasons reform was impossible, he said, was:

* the Papacy had subjugated temporal powers to itself
* Councils could not act as a check to the abuses of the Pope
* nobody else was allowed to show the Papacy where it had erred since it alone could interpret Scripture

=== Nobles Are Leaders of Their People

The language is harsh and inflammatory, urging the nobility in very flattering terms to respond in a way that is their duty both as Christians and leaders of their people

He says that it's a "`desperate`" move, but necessary

This is where he described the doctrine of the Priesthood of All Believers

[NOTE.speaker]
--
As we talked about before, there has long been a growing tension between the power and influence of the Rome and the secular leaders. This was especially true in countries like Germany that had to pay tributes and the like to Rome, but got little in the way of the benefits from such subordination. Therefore, in addition to the theological arguments that Luther was making to appeal to their Christian natures, the treatise had a very practical ring to the nobility.
--

=== The Babylonian Captivity of the Church

Written in Latin, it was intended for a highly educated audience. King Philip IV's of France arrest of Pope Boniface VIII in the 14th Century and the subsequent decades that the Papacy was based out of France became known as the Babylonian Captivity

Luther's title was meant to elicit both that event and the Babylonian Captivity of the Israelites

The work itself focuses on the worship of the Church, particularly on the Sacraments

=== Only Two Sacraments

He argues that instead of the seven Sacraments decreed by the Catholic Church, there should be two (and a half): Baptism and the Lord's Supper

He draws heavily on differences in what the Scriptures say against Church Tradition

By both Catholic and Lutheran doctrine, a Sacrament is a sacred act mandated by Christ in which He offers, gives and seals to us the forgiveness of sins

The reduction from seven to two is because he asserts that it's only the Lord's Supper and Baptism for which those qualifications are clearly met in the Bible

=== Sacrament of Penance

The "`and a half`" is because he's rather ambiguous at this point about Penance; at times hinting that it should be a Sacrament, at times hinting that it shouldn't be

This was caused primarily because while he had worked out that Penance is not a Sacrament by the time he finished the work, his works were such a hot commodity that the publishers wouldn't even let the ink dry before grabbing it from him, much less allowing him such "`luxuries`" as editing and revisions

=== The Freedom of the Christian

Written in both Latin and German, this was his first major clear statement on his views regarding Justification: namely Sola Gratia (By Grace Alone) and Sola Fide (By Faith Alone)

Like Augustine, Luther argued that once we are freed from the bondage of having to concern ourselves over such matters as, "`Am I good enough to go to Heaven?`" we are then capable to perform such acts out of overflowing joy at the love the God has shown toward us

We are no longer grudging slaves to the Law, but slaves to Love; we no longer do things because "`we must,`" but rather because the love of Christ bursts through and we can't help but to be cheerful servants

=== Battle Lines

The Leipzig Disputation and what followed made Luther one of the most recognized Germans in all of Europe, and people were choosing sides

Students were so eager to join his classes that the city of Wittenberg couldn't grow fast enough to contain them, universities threw their support behind him, and princes & lords pledged their resources -- including armies -- to his defense

That support was vital, as many of the orders and other major universities condemned him, and of course he was under the condemnation of both the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire

The battle lines were being drawn, and each week both sides raised the stakes

=== This Had Happened Before

The Hussites had becomes a major force within Bohemia, and that conflict had turned violent (as Luther's conflict would)

It had been a brutal and bloody war that impacted the rest of Europe, and both sides knew well that history looked like it would repeat itself -- though neither side could possibly imagine how dramatically they underestimated what would come


== Luther's Theology

image::luther_theology.jpg[]

=== Retain and Destroy

What he said was a mixture of retaining much of Catholic doctrine while utterly destroying other parts

[.small]
As opposed to, for example, the Anabaptists that we'll talk about later, who wanted to remake/regain a form of Christianity that had virtually nothing in common with Catholicism

=== Luther's Personality

It was in many ways the combination of his personality and theology that made him the ideal rallying point for friend and foe alike

He was extremely humble, scholarly and personally engaging

He was also unbelievably vulgar, harsh and condemning

=== Polemics

His writings tended to be very polemical, and he had an excellent grasp of how to address a specific audience

Whether they loved him or hated him, his mixture of tightly coherent arguments and passion made sure no one could simply ignore him

=== Sola Gratia

Sola Gratia got its greatest defense since Augustine after Erasmus was pressured into writing on his views on free will

In "`On the Freedom of the Will`", Erasmus took the semi-Pelagian view of our having to assent to the grace of God to save us, and that justification was a gradual process of moral reform started by God but continued by us with God's help

Luther's response was his most famous work, "`On the Bondage of the Will`", where he said that humanity is utterly depraved; dead in our sins

We can no more assent to the grace of God's working of faith in our hearts than Lazarus could accent to Jesus' raising him from the dead

=== The Priesthood of All Believers

He said that https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16%3A13-19&version=NIV[Matthew 16:19], which records Jesus granting the keys to the Kingdom, is Jesus giving the keys to all those that make Simon-Peter's confession

(The "`rock`" of the Church is the Gospel, according to Luther, which Simon-Peter had just confessed)

All callings in this world of whatever station in life are equally holy because they are all equally obedient to God

Instead of requiring that clergy perform all mediation between God and believers (be it in the Sacraments or intercessory prayer), every Christian has that right as all power comes from God alone, through the application of Law and Gospel

=== Not "`Extra Holy`"

Though he denied the "`extra holiness`" of the clergy, he insisted that the clergy were still vital to the life and health of the Church

(This was unlike the Anabaptists, who used this doctrine to call for the dissolution of church offices)

They're to be "`professionals`" in God's Word

=== Against Sola Fide

He denied any practice that he felt went against the doctrine of Sola Fide

Such practices included such staples of Catholic doctrine and practice as pilgrimages, indulgences, and bodily asceticism

They are ways in which we try to earn merit before God rather than relying upon the promises that God gave that he would save anyone who believes the Gospel message

=== The Family

Sex is taught to be a "`beastly`" rather than "`heavenly`" activity, and should therefore be avoided

Under Catholic doctrine, the family is essentially a "`necessary evil`" -- it's better to never marry and spend your whole life celibately serving God in the clergy or an order rather than to distract oneself with a family; however, having children and raising them as Catholics is a good way to grow the Church

[.small]
Since the Reformation, the Catholic Church continues to emphasize the family while strengthening the emphasis about the holiness of celibacy

=== The Virgin Mary

It is because of the Catholic condemnation of sex that Rome insists on Mary's perpetual virginity, despite the Bible's repeated "`claims`" to the contrary (e.g. Matthew 1:25)

When a Protestant refers the "`the Virgin Mary`" he's referring to the fact that she was a virgin when she conceived Christ

Catholics confess that she remained a virgin her entire life; just as Jesus wasn't conceived through sex -- and thereby sullied by its taint -- neither was Mary

=== Luther On the Family

Luther said that wasn't the case at all -- he celebrated the family and denounced the vow of celibacy's claim to somehow make a person more holy

[.small]
(As with everything else, he said that it wasn't celibacy that was wrong, it was the belief that it made you more holy. There's a time and place for celibacy, but not for doing it for the wrong reasons)

Luther taught that the Bible is filled with wedding and sexual imagery for a reason, as it is in that union that we get our best glimpse at the love God has for His Church

[NOTE.speaker]
--
To be clear: when discussing doctrine -- Catholic, Lutheran, or whatever -- I'm referring to "`official`" doctrine.  What is actually communicated to the laity is often quite different.

This also had a major impact on society's views on prostitution and the like. Though the Catholic Church officially condemns prostitution, fornication, etc., it has always tended to turn a blind eye toward it as a matter of practicality since it discourages every other outlet for "`the animal urges.`" While Protestant doctrine praises sexuality within marriage, it also condemns prostitution, fornication and the like as being a perversion of the gracious gift that God has given us. However, unlike Catholicism, Protestantism provides for and strongly encourages a "`proper`" place for sex. This meant that in Protestant countries fornication et-al were no longer tolerated as "`necessary evils.`"
--

=== Overturning Social Order

While today it seems strange that such a big deal was made of what Luther was saying, such changes to ancient understandings of the clergy and the family didn't happen without controversy...

=== Hesitant To Change Social Norms

image::gay_parents.jpg[height="400px",role="left",alt="http://www.jewishnews.co.uk/gay-surrogacy/"]

image::female_priest.png[height="400px",role="right",alt="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JeffertsSchori.JPG"]

While some parts of the Church agreed with what he was doing, the majority was "`hesitant`"


=== High Stakes

Do you **_really_** believe that Salvation is a matter of eternity?

Do you **_really_** believe you're going to be dead for a LOT longer than you'll be alive?

=== Who Is Worse?

image::holmes_luther_manson.png[]

One of these people potentially has damned the souls of millions of blood-bought innocent children of God...

The other two sent a handful of people to God early

[.small]
Of course it could be the Pope instead of Luther on this slide. The point -- the stakes of preaching against God -- is the same
