=== Henry's Marriage to Catherine

Henry VIII was married to Catherine of Aragon and the two of them had born only one child that survived infancy:

Mary I

Catherine bore six children, including three sons, but besides Mary none lived more than a few hours to a couple months
--

=== Wanting A Male Heir

In an attempt to both marry his mistress, Anne Boyle, and bear a son, Henry petitioned Pope Clement VII for an annulment of his marriage

=== Henry and Pope Clement VII

There was precedent for Clement to grant the request, and in many ways he would have liked to do it for a powerful king that was such a strong ally of the Catholic Church

=== Pope Clement VII's Annulment Problems

Pope Clement had two major problems preventing him from doing so:

one was ecclesiastical and one was political

=== Dispensation for the First Marriage

The first major problem was that it had taken a Papal dispensation in order for Henry to marry Catherine (who had been widowed by Henry's older brother) in the first place

[.small]
--
By Old Testament law, marrying the wife of your brother https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20:21[(Leviticus 20:21)] was forbidden, and therefore had been forbidden in Catholic practice
--

=== Clement's Ecclesiastical Problem

When a marriage is annulled, it's declared to have been illegitimate -- it should never have happened

If Clement declared an annulment for the marriage, he would directly contradict Pope Julius`' proclamation twenty years earlier

=== Clement's Political Problem

Charles V -- the Holy Roman Emperor -- is the nephew of Catherine

To declare that for almost twenty years Katherine had been essentially living in sin would have been an enormous embarrassment to the House of Aragon and the House of Hapsburg

=== Alienating Charles V

Obviously, even if you're the Pope, it's a really good idea to have the Emperor on your side...

...especially when you're trying to fight the Reformation

=== Really Bad Timing

In 1527 Charles had sacked Rome and had made the Pope a virtual prisoner

Just after that happened, Henry made his petition for annulment

=== Should He Dishonor the Families of the Empire?

Dishonoring the Emperor like that would have surely prompted Charles to forcibly destroy every ounce of power that the Papacy still had

The Reformation was really growing and therefore the Papacy was in even more danger than it had been during the "`Babylonian Captivity`" under King Philip IV

== Henry Tries To Get His Way

=== Henry Is Not Pleased

A king like Henry isn't used to being told, "`No,`" so when that answer came back from Clement, Henry was "`displeased`"

He started badgering the English clergy, hoping that enough pressure from within the church would cause Clement to see the **_reasonableness_** of Henry's request

=== "`Reasonable`" Reforms

He started small, getting some laws passed in the House of Commons designed to shore up popular support by stopping clerical abuses and the like

At the same time he removed some of the "`rights and privileges`" that the clergy had enjoyed

=== Trying To Get Priests To Contradict the Pope

He also canvassed theological opinions in both England and on the continent, trying to get theologians to agree that -- because of the prohibition in Leviticus -- that the marriage was illegitimate

However, since it's Catholic theologians that he needs to say this, and they obviously can't come out and say that the Pope had made a mistake, he doesn't get very far

=== The Rise of Thomas Cromwell

Frustrated with the lack of results, Henry created a think-tank, trying to come up with ways to legitimize his desire

The most important man on that council was Thomas Cromwell, who was secretly a Lutheran sympathizer

=== Protestants Are Those Closest To Him

Henry's wife-to-be, Anne Boleyn, was also a secret Protestant sympathizer

She worked with Cromwell to make sure that Papal authority would be lessened (and hopefully broken) so as to pave the way for a Protestant Reformation in England

=== Applying Financial Pressure

In 1532, Henry used intense royal pressure to push through Parliament a bill to stop annual payments to Rome, hoping to coerce Clement through financial means

[.small]
--
It certainly helped that it increased royal coffers since Henry was perpetually in debt because of personal excesses and wars on the continent
--

=== Taking Away Ecclesiastical Independence

The far more radical and important bill passed that year was that the clergy surrender their legal independence to the crown

There would no longer be a separate set of laws for the clergy to be tried only in ecclesiastical courts

=== Henry's Lord Chancellor Resigns

This was so controversial that Thomas More, Henry's Lord Chancellor (the highest office in England short of the King) resigned the day after the bill was passed

=== No Higher Court

In 1533 the extreme measure was taken of forbidding all ecclesiastical appeals to Rome

The meant that once something had made it to the top in the church system in England, it could go no further

=== Thomas Crammer Is The Archbishop of Canterbury

Henry had just named Thomas Crammer the Archbishop of Canterbury (the highest ecclesiastical office in England) with the "`understanding`" that Crammer would grant Henry's annulment

=== Crammer's Allegiance

Crammer was also secretly a Protestant, and therefore saw this as the perfect opportunity to help prepare England for the Reformation

=== Anne Is Pregnant

What prompted Henry to push so hard so fast was that in January of 1533 he learned that Anne was pregnant

They quickly arranged a secret marriage

=== Henry Gets His Annulment

In May, Crammer granted Henry the annulment and validated the marriage that Henry and Anne had done in secret

=== Henry Is Threatened With Excommunication

Pope Clement threatened Henry with excommunication, which did little but make Henry even madder

=== Elizabeth Is Born

In September Anne gave birth to a baby:

Elizabeth I

=== Catherine And Mary Stripped of Title

The Act of Succession was passed in March of 1534, declaring that Mary was a bastard child and therefore not the legitimate heir to the throne

=== Elizabeth Is the True Heir

Elizabeth, the child of the lawful union between Henry and Anne, was the rightful heir

Any speaking or writing against such logic was to be regarded as treason and punishable by death

=== Oath of the Act of Succession

Finally, every adult male in the kingdom had to take an oath accepting the Act of Succession

Thomas More was among the small number of people who refused to take the oath, and therefore arrested and put in the Tower of London

=== The Act of Supremacy

The Act of Supremacy followed later that year, declaring that the king was the "`supreme head of the church in England`"

Dissent against this was also considered treason and required an oath of affirmation by every adult male subject

This severed all (official) ties between the Church in England with Rome and the rest of Catholic Church, and completely subjugated the Church to Henry
