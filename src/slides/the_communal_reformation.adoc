== The Communal Reformation

image::bruegel-the-fight-between-carnival-and-lent.jpg[height="600px"]

=== Rebellions

Remember back to the social conditions of the Late Middle Ages: the peasants had gained some **_relative_** wealth and privileges following the Black Death, but as time went on those rights were being taken away again by the nobility and clergy

This, naturally, caused a great deal of discord among the "`common man`" (peasants and urbanites sympathetic to them) as they agitated to win back the freedoms that they were loosing

=== Not Just Another Rebellion

When things really got hot, rebellion burst forth, and the ruling powers had crushed dozens of rebellions during the time period of the mid 1400's to 1524

=== No Longer Enough To Go Back

Appeals to the Gospel added to the social grievances made things much hotter

=== Remaking All of Society Around the Gospel

They no longer wanted to **_merely_** return to earlier traditions and ways

They want to completely change society

=== All Of Christian Life

As opposed to Zwingli's attempt to reform just a city, the peasants wanted to reform the very fabric of society in general

=== The Twelve Articles of the Upper Swabian Peasants

There were a number of articulations of what the people wanted, but the most influential was the Twelve Articles of the Upper Swabian Peasants (February 1525)

Tens of thousands of copies are made -- an absolutely enormous number for the time

=== "`That We Are Free`"

Social and political reforms were tied intimately, as can be seen by the third article:

[quote]
____
"`Christ redeemed all of us with His precious blood -- the shepherd as well as the man of highest station -- without exception. This is provided by the Scriptures that we are -- and shall be -- free`"
____

This disputed the legitimacy of serfdom and the other duties that subjugated the "`lower`" to the "`higher`" in the feudal social order

[.small.tight]
--
They were not asking for anarchy, as evidenced by the rest of the third article: "`Not that we would wish to be absolutely free and under no authority. God does not teach us that we should lead a disorderly life in the lusts of the flesh, but that we should love the Lord our God and our neighbour. We would gladly observe all this as God has commanded us in the celebration of the communion. He has not commanded us not to obey the authorities, but rather that we should be humble, not only towards those in authority, but towards every one. We are thus ready to yield obedience according to God's law to our elected and regular authorities in all proper things becoming to a Christian. We, therefore, take it for granted that you will release us from serfdom as true Christians, unless it should be shown us from the Gospel that we are serfs.`"
--

=== Bringing More Power To The People

Elected councils were to replace lords, and churches were to be able to choose their clergy

The underlying principles of the religious and social order were being radically challenged

=== Undoing Society

Remember, that was about all that was holding civilization together at the time...



== Thomas Müntzer

image::Thomas_Muentzer.jpg[alt="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Thomas_Muentzer.jpg"]

=== No Compromising the Gospel

One of the major leaders in the various revolutions that would make up the Peasant's War was Thomas Müntzer in central Germany

He was a radical preacher and critic of the other major reformers for not being strong enough in their convictions and faith to overthrow the existing social order

=== Müntzer's Divergence

At first Müntzer associated himself with Luther, but he quickly diverged and developed his own theology

The two biggest areas of divergence were:

* his form of Christian mysticism
* his desire to radically overthrow the existing social order

=== Inner Word and Outer Word

He distinguished sharply between

* the "`**Inner Word**`" -- created by a direct mystical work of God through tribulation
* a bogus "`**Outer Word**`" -- created by merely **_reading_** the Bible while in comfortable privilege

=== God's Word Isn't Confined

God's Word isn't confined to merely what the Bible said, but it is a **_vibrant and changing_** power that can remake the world just like it had created it

Luther and the like were no better than the Catholic clergy: lackeys of the princes, grasping nothing of the true Christian faith and trying to stand in the way of letting the Word remake the world

[.small]
--
Luther was a easy target for Müntzer because he was so concerned about keeping the church and state separate areas of concern least they both be corrupted. Even Zwingli, who was working to reform and merge the political and religious realms, was doing it with the existing authorities and occasionally conceding to their concerns.
--

=== Those Who Know the Inner Word

Müntzer further divided the world into

* the Godly -- those that knew the "`Inner Word`" and would help usher in God's Kingdom
* the Godless -- those who lacked the Inner Word and therefore upheld the corrupt social and ecclesiastical order

=== Destroying the Godless

It was the duty of the Godly to destroy the Godless so that God's Kingdom could be realized and bring about the end of the world

This fit perfectly into the growing apocalypticism of the time, and the two fed off each other

=== Active Apocalypticism

While Luther was also very apocalyptic, his was a passive apocalypticism -- letting God do the work on His own timetable

image::338px-Durer_Revelation_Four_Riders.jpg[role="left",alt="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Durer_Revelation_Four_Riders.jpg"]

Müntzer's was a very active apocalypticism -- seeing himself as an agent of actively bringing about the Apocalypse

=== Judgement Day

The Church has always held that Judgment Day will happen when the last person to be converted has been converted

That's always been seen as a major impetuous for the Great Commission -- preaching to the Godless and baptizing them so that they could be added to the ranks of the Godly

=== No More Godless

Another way of looking at it is that if there are no more Godless, then there's no one left to convert, so God's Kingdom could then come immediately

=== The Battle of Frankenhausen

The culmination of Müntzer's appeals to the people to rise up came at the battle of Frankenhausen, where he led approximately 9,000 peasants into battle

The peasants were armed only with farm tools, and they went up against professional solders: cavalry, knights and artillery units

=== Müntzer Was Not Gideon

image::Gideon_and_his_three_hundred_men.jpg[role="right"]

Müntzer promised the peasants that they could not possibly loose, as God was on their side

Müntzer was wrong

=== Death Toll

The toll for the peasants: approximately 5,000 dead in the battle, and many more maimed and wounded (more would die later as they were executed for treason)

Fewer than *ten* of the professional soldiers were killed

[.small]
--
Granted, even beyond the difference is skill and equipment, the lords broke a truce so it was a surprise attack in the town instead of the field of battle
--

Müntzer was captured and, unsurprisingly, quickly tried for treason and executed

=== A Hero To Many

While generally seen as a "`wild-eyed radical,`" Müntzer is also often viewed in a very positive light by both fundamentalist Christians and Marxists

=== A Dead Faith

Müntzer felt that a faith that didn't affect concrete change for the betterment of the common people was a dead faith

=== A Tool of the Establishment

Allowing -- and even worse, **_supporting_** -- an established social order that oppressed people could not be called real Christianity

Such a Christianity was merely a tool of the established political order -- an "`opiate for the masses,`" to quote Marx on the subject -- and therefore not what Jesus taught when he preached about social justice



== The Peasant's War

image::339px-Titelblatt_12_Artikel.jpg[alt="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Titelblatt_12_Artikel.jpg"]

=== A Collection of Uprisings

"`The Peasant's War`" is a collection of uprisings that occurred at roughly the same time (1524-1525) with roughly the same goals, but there was no central organizing group or set of issues that brought them together

There were many battles like the battle of Frankenhausen, all with pretty much exactly the same result

=== Difficulty Fielding Soldiers

In addition to a total lack of competent military leadership, solder training, coordination or equipment, they couldn't even keep solders in the field

Peasants are tied closely to the land, and if you're not there to tend to your fields, your family will die of starvation

=== A War Without Equal

image::liberty.jpg[role="left"]

It was the largest mass uprising in all of European history until the French Revolution

=== One Sided

Unlike the French Revolution, this one was horrendously one-sided, with many more dead

There were between 70,000 -- 100,000 dead, almost exclusively peasants

=== Reformation Could No Longer Be Tolerated

The Peasant's War was a major wake-up call for everyone and a crucial turning point in the Reformation

It essentially destroyed the Reformation as a popular social movement

=== Fear By the Common People

Anything with even the slightest **_hint_** of radicalism (i.e., anything that called for basically any change at all from the status quo) was immediately identified by the common people with the horrors of the war and carried its stigma



== The Power of Princes

image::0371254-LUTHERAN-TITLE-PAGE-1525-Title-page-for-Against-the-Murderous-Thieving-Hordes-of-Peasants-by-Martin-Luther-in-response-to-the-German-Peasants-War-published-in-Wittenberg-1525.jpg[]

=== Luther's Response

Reformers like Luther were appalled at what the peasants were doing, seeing it as an incredible perversion of true reform

Instead it was mere rebelliousness and selfishness hijacking the good name of genuine reform in the guise of religious sincerity

=== Against the Murdering Thieving Hoards of Peasants

Luther wrote a famous pamphlet called "`Against the Murdering, Thieving Hoards of Peasants`"

=== Sympathetic To The Need for Social Reform

He is sympathetic to the grievances of the peasants and urged magistrates to do needed reforms to ease the life of the people

=== Romans 13

However, as the title suggests, Luther says that open rebellion like that crossed the line and was a direct contradiction to Romans 13:1-2

Therefore he not only tells the magistrates that they must suppress the rebellions, but that they must do so **_severely_** to make sure that people aren't tempted to do so again

Their *harshness* is their Christian duty as God's legitimate leaders

=== Trust In the Power of Princes

This doesn't sit well with a lot of the people, who saw him as being very hypocritical when it came to serious reform

=== Cowardly Reform

Luther and the other magisterial reformers were seen to have validated Müntzer's assessment of them -- they wanted reform, but only a cowardly and safe reform that trusted in the power of princes rather than in the power of God

=== Magisterial Reformers

Magisterial reformers like Luther, Zwingli and Calvin have the designation of "`magisterial`" primarily to distinguish them from the politically radical reformers like Müntzer

The magisterial reformers worked **_with_** the magistrates to accomplish reform, rather than against them

=== Drawing Distinctions

The magisterial reformers worked extremely hard to distinguish themselves from radicals like Müntzer

Catholics worked very hard to force that association in the minds of people so that the magisterial reformers would be "`guilty by association`"

=== Quelling Dissent

The Peasant's War had a dramatic affect on the political and ecclesiastical leadership

Before they had often cautiously tolerated calls for social and religious reform...

The scope of the Peasant's War caused them to be terrified of agitation even remotely like what had lead to the revolts

It became a touchstone for the need to quell any dissent

=== Domesticated Reform

Even in regions where the authorities are sympathetic to the Reformation, they work extremely hard to make sure that it proceeds in very controlled and "`domesticated`" way

Never again would anything major happen that was not sanctioned by the local political authorities -- anything else would be crushed brutally before it would have a chance to grow

=== Blowback

The long-term effect of the Peasant's War was the exact opposite of what those that fought for it wanted

**It greatly solidified the power and control of the political authorities and the established social order**

Nobody wanted to come anywhere near what had happened before
