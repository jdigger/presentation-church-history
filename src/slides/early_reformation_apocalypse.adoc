== Apocalypse Now

image::Whore_of_Babylon_1522_Luther_New_Testament.jpg[alt=""]

=== Signs of the Last Judgement

The Reformation from its very beginning -- and increasingly so as tensions grew to their boiling point and beyond -- had a very apocalyptic feel to it

The Anti-Christ (i.e., the Pope) was now ruling the earth

The section graphic was The Whore of Babylon riding the seven-headed beast of https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+17&version=NIV[Revelation 17] from the 1522 Luther New Testament wearing the papal tiara

=== God's Judgement Is Increasingly Clear

The persecutions were sharply compared to the tribulation(s) that the Bible talks about leading the Last Judgment

The fast-growing nature of the movement -- with its emphasis on the truth of God's Word -- made people see God taking an ever-greater role directly in what was happening

=== Impatient In Saving the Lost

This apocalypticism caused people to be extremely impatient and militant in their desire to save souls

This was made even sharper because they felt that for hundreds of years Christendom had been deceived into eternal damnation by the very institution that was designed to protect her, which made people absolutely furious at the Catholic Church

=== The Worst Kind of Betrayal

image::053_AltarGirls.jpg[role="right",height="200px"]

Though it's hardly a pretty picture, the indignation was akin to the thought of a father raping and killing his daughter

The very one put by God on the earth to provide for and protect that child had instead betrayed and violated her in the most profound way possible

=== Are You For Christ or the Anti-Christ?

This caused extreme polarization: you were either for Christ or the Anti-Christ, with absolutely no middle ground

=== Tired of Waiting

The leaders of the early Reformation tended to be people of position and power who had been in the Catholic Church and had become sick of the abuses, superstitions and lack of any real reform from Rome

[.small]
We'll see later that Rome was not passive and would take reforming seriously, but too little too late for many

=== Brain Drain From the Church

Those that went over to the Reformation **_tended_** to be those in the mendicant orders (like the Franciscans and Augustinians) and the highly educated clergy

The Catholic Church was experiencing a substantial "`brain drain,`" loosing its best Biblical scholars to the Reformation, as they were the most frustrated with attempts with internal reform

=== Diabolical Conspiracy

Whereas in previous generations such frustrations and attempts at reforms were directed against "`the establishment,`" the apocalyptic nature of the Reformation made it a very diabolical conspiracy

It wasn't just "`foolish people`" involved -- the battle lines were being drawn for the final show-down between Darkness and Light, with God gathering His troops, and Satan taking an increased hand in guiding his forces

=== Going Beyond Words

The bi-polar atmosphere caused people to go well beyond words

Clergy were heckled and harassed, religious processions were blockaded, icons and other sacred objects were desecrated (like urinating in baptismal fonts and using letters of indulgences for toilet paper) or destroyed

These were **_very, very_** angry people

== Defining the Early Doctrines of the Reformation

=== But What Are You For?

During the early years of the Reformation, sentiment tended to be more anti-Catholic than pro-Protestant

Much of the language of the time sounded like what we're all used to hearing from politicians -- very vague and heavy with demagoguery

=== What's the Alternative?

The abuses of the Catholic Church everybody could see and understand, but the alternative was still being defined

=== A Gospel Consensus?

There was a strong sense of optimism that as more and more people read the Bible, a consensus would emerge, wiping away the old and current divisions

However, as we all know, the Catholic Church was right in its assertion that giving the Bible to the masses would result in anarchy instead of unity

[.small]
In our modern world, the "`denomination system`" has brought order, if not unity, to the splintering. But before denominations were developed, there was indeed anarchy

=== Scholarly Bickering

An example of confusion added to the fray was the arguments between the Lutherans and Zwinglians

It was hard to take either side too seriously hearing the primary scholars bickering over whether to emphasize "`this is my body`" vs "`do this in remembrance of me`" in the **_very same words of institution_**

=== Nit-picking Against the Gospel?

It seems nit-picky to the extreme to argue over if Jesus' flesh and blood are physically there when everyone agrees that Christ **_is_** there, the efficacy of the eucharist, and the effects of the sacrament

=== Lesser of the Evils?

This was especially hard to stomach when there is the **_overwhelming_** threat of the "`powerful idolotors`" (a.k.a., Catholic authorities) who clearly barely had the Gospel at all

=== Not Nit-Picking

image::instrumental-non-instrumental.jpg[role="right"]

It wasn't, in fact, mere nit-picking since it has implications on Christology -- which affects how you read the entire Bible

But you can see why people would impatient when there's a _potential_ danger (which takes a lot of Biblical education to even see why it would be) versus a clear-and-**_extremely_**-present danger

=== The Sufficiency of Scripture

By Protestant doctrine the Bible is "`sufficient`" and "`clear`"

Protestant doctrine says that the problem is that humans are sinful, and therefore bring their own sinful desires and faulty reasoning to the Bible, distorting what would be plain if not for our sinfulness

=== Bolstering Catholic Continuing Revelation

By Catholic doctrine, the Bible is not "`self contained`" and needs the further revelation provided by the Church to fill in the gaps

The Catholic Church also agrees with this assessment of humanity's inability to properly interpret the Bible, and therefore asserts that it is all the more reason why we are dependent upon the Church -- with her special graces given by God -- to perform all interpretation
