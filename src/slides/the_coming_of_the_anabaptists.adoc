== The Coming of the Anabaptists

image::Baptism-2.jpg[height="400px"]

=== Radical Reformers

The peasants that fought in the Peasant's War were "`radical`" Reformers:

Protestants concerned with radically remaking society into what they considered the Bible to demand

A different but related strain of radicals were the Anabaptists

They were emerging in many places, but the real core were those that survived the war and came out of Zwingli's Zurich

=== Infant Baptism Is Against Sola Fide

Zwingli, like most everyone else, believed in infant baptism

Conrad Grebel, Felix Mantz and others in Zurich said that doing so is an affront to the central doctrine of the Reformation: Sola Fide

=== Only Faith In Christ's Work Is Saving

According to _sola fide_, it's not "`faith`" in and of itself that saves you -- it's faith that Christ has saved you from your sin

The problem is, there is no way a baby can understand such a concept, and therefore no way that a baby can have saving faith

=== A Christian Without Saving Faith?

For the Anabaptists, Baptism is a crucial event, marking you as a child of God and bringing you into the larger "`community of faith`"

[.larger]
**But if a baby can't have saving faith, then baptizing them would mean that you're saying that someone can be a Christian without faith**

=== Believe Then Be Baptized

It makes far more sense, then, for someone to make a profession of faith and **_then_** be baptized

=== Biblical Support

They could easily demonstrate many examples of people professing faith and **_then_** being baptized in the Bible

There are no clear examples of baptism before faith, and no **_clear_** instances of babies (or even young children) being baptized

For example, they interpreted Mark 16:16 as prescribing an order of events: believe, then be baptized

=== Inner Baptism

According to the Swiss Brethren (the Anabaptists in Zurich), you must first experience an "`inner baptism`" where God works faith in your heart

It is then that you have an "`outer baptism`" (i.e., what is normally considered Baptism) as an outer sign of your commitment

=== Wetting Rocks

Baptizing an infant is a superstitious act of pouring water on an unthinking being

It is like "`getting a rock wet`"

=== Illegitimate Baptisms

Therefore that meant that even if you had been baptized previously as an infant, you have to be baptized as an adult for it to be a real Baptism

It's getting baptized again that got them their name:

_ana-baptism_ means **re-baptism**

[.small]
--
Remember the Donatist controversy, where they said that if you hadn't been baptized by a Donatist you hadn't really been baptized and therefore needed to be baptized again by them...

=== Lutheran Baptism

Lutheran doctrine also strongly affirms Sola Fide, but just as strongly affirms infant baptism

The Lutheran position on what the Anabaptists believe to be a contradiction is, put simply, "`We don't fully understand how God could create saving faith in a child through baptism, but He promises to do so, so we simply believe Him`"

=== The Necessity of Baptism

Just as with the Donotist controversy, everyone agreed that Baptism is vital

For all intents and purposes, without it you're not a Christian and therefore not saved

=== Rejecting the Community

In addition to that, in Medieval Europe everyone was baptized: it acted not only as a "`rite of passage`" into the community of faith, but into the community in general

If you refused to have your child baptized, then you were repudiating **_both_** the church and your community

=== Pacifism

Another radical feature of the Swiss Brethren was their pacifism

They took passages like Matthew 5:39 in a very straight forward way

Not only do not start a fight, but don't even defend yourself

=== Taking Up Your Cross

Admittedly it's extremely hard to do, but Christ made it very clear that following him would be like that

=== Unable To Meet the Demands of God

Only those that accepted and did this radical pacifism, "`rebaptism`" and other crucial doctrines -- no matter how hard it might be to do -- could be true Christians

Believing and doing it aren't done on your own power, but on God's

=== Without God's Grace

If you can't do it then you hadn't received God's grace and are therefore damned

=== Proof of Faith

Luther, Zwingli and the other Magisterial Reformers insisted on justification by faith alone -- that such radical "`manifestations`" of faith weren't required

They considered what the Anabaptist were doing as being the same as -- if not worse than in many ways --the "`works righteousness`" of Catholicism

=== The Day Anabaptism Was Born

The "`official`" start of Anabaptism was January 1525, when the first adult baptisms were performed in direct defiance of the new law that Zwingli and the Zurich Council had enacted requiring that infants be baptized

After that it was suppressed in Zurich, but it grew rapidly in the towns and cities around Zurich
