== Crossing the Channel

=== England

Like France, England was far more rural than Germany or the Low Countries, with the same "`buffering`" effect against new ideas seen in France

Like the Low Countries, however, England had a stronger history and culture of Humanists than France, and Humanistic learning is on equal footing with Scholasticism at English universities

=== Publication Hub

Protestant writings out of Germany were being translated and smuggled into England almost as soon as the 95 Theses were posted, most of which were being translated and published back onto the continent

=== William Tyndale

The most famous and important of these smuggled works was William Tyndale's translation of the New Testament in 1526, which formed the basis of all subsequent English translations (including the King James Version a hundred years later)

Tyndale had spent time in Wittenberg and knew Luther personally

=== Tyndale Kindling

Having so much as a single page of the Tyndale's New Testament was considered so subversive that -- under some of the most severe repression -- it could get you burned at the stake, with the page being used as the kindling for the fire

Today, one of the largest Christian publishing companies in the world, Tyndale House Publishers, is named in his honor

=== England's Very Catholic King

England had a very powerful and very Catholic king in Henry VIII, who in many ways was an even more staunch an opponent to Luther's writings than Charles V was

=== "`Defender of the Faith`"

image::Henry_VIII_Cover.jpg[role="right"]

In 1521 he put his name on (and helped write) the "`Defense of the Seven Sacraments`"

It's an ultra-conservative and anti-Lutheran work that earned him the title of "`Defender of the Faith`" from Pope Leo X

=== Henry VIII Exalts the Papal Office

In one of the great ironies of history, in it he put forward an extremely exalted view of the Papal office -- over the objections of his advisors, including Sir Thomas More

[.small]
--
Sir Thomas More was a noted Humanist, a good friend of Erasmus, and the author of "`Utopia`"
--

This will be exceedingly ironic...

=== Crushing Attempts At Reform

Henry used his strong political power to work with the Catholic bishops in very effectively crushing attempts for reform throughout England

[.small]
--
There were Protestants that did dare to preach, and they stirred up some minor trouble

In general, though, they were "`strongly encouraged`" to recant once caught, and with enough "`encouragement`" most did so
--

There were public book burnings and executions of Protestants that would not recant
