== Reforms by Catholic People and Clergy

=== Adapting To Change

The Catholic Church has always changed and adapted

Sometimes it is in "`positive`" terms (e.g., creating new orders)

Sometimes it is in "`negative`" terms (e.g., cracking down on clerical abuses)

=== Just Another Reformation

When the Reformation started, Luther and the rest figured that the reforms they were calling for would fall within that long tradition

However, as Johan Eck showed Luther, what Luther was calling for had implications that were far too radical for the Catholic Church to accept

=== Who Are the Radicals?

The term "`radical`" is an interesting word, because the Reformers contended that it was the Catholics that were "`radical`": it was Rome that had steered the Church radically from the teachings of ancient Christianity

The Augsburg Confession (the "`Declaration of Independence`" for the Reformers) and similar writings go to great lengths to make this point

=== Ancient Roots

The reformers constantly quote many of the early Church Fathers, showing how the "`modern`" Catholic Church was different from the beliefs of the early Church

The Protestants were the ones following the Church Father's teachings, bringing the Church back to her ancient roots

=== Non-Reformation Reforms

Even without being "`reformed`" by the Reformation, the Catholic Church continued to change during the 16th Century (though some of the changes were undoubtedly influenced by the ideas coming out of the Reformation)

These reforms were prompted largely by people sympathetic to the complaints of the Protestants, but they didn't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater

=== Problem In Practice, Not Doctrine

They contended that the things that everyone was complaining about were symptoms of institutional problems and a lack of true spirituality among the clergy and people, not a fundamental doctrinal problem like the Protestants were insisting

=== Active Spiritual Life

To address the problems experienced in the Church by the doctrine of "`implicit faith,`" a number of priests, orders and confraternities began to get serious about encouraging a much more active spiritual life:

* coming to mass several times a month
* going to Confession as often as possible or at least once a week
* participating in the Eucharist at least six times a year
* more pilgrimages
* more emphasis on images and relics
* etc.

=== Embracing Catholicism More Deeply

The solution to the problems in the Catholic Church was not to break away from Catholicism, but to embrace it even more deeply

=== Work On the Priests

The **_priesthood_**, for example, is not a problem

**_Bad priests_** are the problem

If you have exemplary priests, the issue goes away

=== The Role of the Priest

The Old Testament priesthood held two primary functions: to intercede for the people to God, and to make the sacrifices

Under Catholic doctrine, the priest (and those higher than him, such as a Bishop) continues to intercede to God (either directly or through the saints) for his parishioners

=== Mass vs Priesthood of All Believers

Part of the Protestant doctrine of the Priesthood of All Believers is that Jesus is our intercessor

We are to go directly to Him

We have no need of any human -- alive or dead -- to speak on our behalf

=== Insulting Christ and the Holy Spirit

The Protestant content that not going straight to Christ is an affront both upon Christ and the Holy Spirit:

* Christ: it's His job to plead our case before the Father
* Holy Spirit: He's our counselor/advocate (in the legal sense -- the word in places like John 14:16 is "`parakletos`")

=== Increase of Confraternities

In response to devastating wars, plagues and crop failures in the early 16th Century -- and making good use of the increased desire to live their Catholic faith discussed above -- a number of confraternities were formed to take care of people

Some were general "`help`" groups, while others specialized in dealing with specific problems (like leper colonies, attending to death row prisoners, teaching poor children, etc.)

While a few of the confraternities were exclusive (you had to be of a certain social standing), most were inclusive: cardinals and dukes would change bedpans arm-in-arm with field laborers

=== Franciscans

The Capuchins were a reform of the Observant Franciscans (which itself was a reform of the original Franciscan order), and went back to the original teachings of St. Francis of Assisi

This meant a renewed emphasis on the Franciscan virtues of humility, poverty and simplicity

Like Francis, this meant that they never touched money, spent their time among the most hopelessly destitute and sick, and practiced a very simple and practical form of Christianity

== The Society of Jesus

=== Jesuits

By far the most important and influential of the new orders is the Society of Jesus: the Jesuits

Ignatius Loyola, a Spaniard, established the Jesuits in Paris, and received official papal approval in 1540

=== Jesuit Institution

According to the papal bull of institution, the purpose of the order is

* to promote the advancement of souls in Christian doctrine and life
* to hear confessions
* to propagate the faith by preaching and the ministering of God's Word, by works of charity and spiritual exercises, and by teaching boys and the uneducated basic Christianity

=== Para-Priests

Even though the Jesuits had been commissioned to perform many of the same duties as the priests, they perform those tasks in a very different way from the priests

The Jesuits tend to be much more pragmatic in the ways they seek to do things to "`the greater glory of God`" by doing whatever is necessary according to a superior (who, through the chain of command, is answerable directly to the Pope)

=== Vow of Total Obedience

In addition to the vows that the clergy have to take, Jesuits take a forth: a vow of total obedience to the Pope, to go wherever, whenever, and do whatever is required of them

This forth vow and their "`pragmatic`" approach earned the Jesuits their reputation as being the Pope's "`shock troops`" -- they would take care of problems no matter where it happened to be, on a moment's notice, and would do whatever it took to resolve to situation

They were also often the ones that would be sent into the most dangerous of the mission fields

Usually, resolving a problem meant leading an education campaign, but it often also involved heading an inquisition. (More "`direct`" ways of making a problem disappear were rare, but not unknown.)

=== Jesuit Education

By about a decade after their institution, the Jesuits became famous for their major focus on education

By the end of the 16th century, they had become the educators of both children and adults throughout the entire Catholic world

=== The Spiritual Exercises

Ignatius Loyola developed The Spiritual Exercises, a guide meant to be used as part of a four week retreat under the supervision of a spiritual director to help people know God's particular will for their life

The purpose was to bring the person through an intense examination of his own sin, to a detachment to worldly things, to seeing everything only in terms of its relationship to God's glory, and the end of his own salvation

=== Extreme Respect

It is because of the extremes of the Jesuits -- their remarkable flexibility, their complete devotion to Catholic faith and practice, and their utter devotion to be the very best at what they have been called to do -- that made the Jesuits so incredibly feared, admired and effective

They sought to fix Catholic problems by being examples of Catholicism at its best
