=== Calls for Internal Reform

Within the institutional Catholic Church, there had long been many calls for reforms

During the first part of the 16th Century, reform from -- and especially in -- the Vatican did not rank high on the various Pope's duties

There was an exception to this: the Dutch Pope, Adrian VI. But his pontificate only lasted a year and a half.

=== The Reformation Causing People To Leave

As soon as the Reformation started, calls for an ecumenical council to address the problems got even louder, and they continued to grow in power and urgency as the Reformation grew

Disillusioned Catholics were "`jumping the fence`" and it was clear that Rome needed to do more than essentially call it a non-issue

=== Caving To the Heretics

One issue was that rushing to put together such a council now would make it look like Rome's caving to the Protestants, further undermining its authority with the people

=== Undermining Papal Authority

It was feared that Councils would receive more power at Papal expense

The Papacy had just recently (in 1430) broken the back of Council power after the Western Schism, so returning to that was out of the question

=== Political Issues With Reform

Even trying to put together such a council was extremely difficult politically

There was profound disagreement some pretty basic questions:

* Where should it be held?
* Who should be invited?

=== Spain and Germany on the Council

Both Charles V and the Protestants wanted the council

* to be held within the Empire
* with the Protestants as participants
* without direct Papal interference

=== France on the Council

Francis I of France feared that reconciliation between the Protestants and the Catholics -- especially one that had been sponsored by Charles V -- would strengthen the Empire's power in it's battles with France

=== The Vatican on the Council

Because it was a matter of the Church, Papal authorities wanted the council

* to take place on Italian soil
* without any of the heretics present
* under direct control of the Pope

=== Charles Bypasses the Pope

Charles V desperately wanted these issues resolved to heal the Empire, but not even his control of Rome could force Clement II to call such a council

In 1530 he essentially bypasses the Pope and convenes a council between Catholic and Protestants

=== The Augsburg Confession

Rather than reaching an agreement, however, it produced the Augsburg Confession, sharply drawing the theological battle lines between the Protestants (particularly the Lutherans) and the Catholics

=== Pope Paul III Gets Serious

Pope Paul III (papacy: 1534-1549) finally made serious efforts toward reform and reconciliation by the Papacy

In preparation for the council, he asked a group of highly respected cardinals to frankly address the problems in the Church, and draft a document on what needed to be handled by the council

=== The Cardinals' Recommendations

The cardinals were blunt, and directly spoke to such matters as:

* the decadence of many orders (and that those orders might need to be dissolved completely)
* the buying and selling and clerical benefices
* ordination of unfit priests
* priests that weren't in their parishes and bishops not in their diocese
* the importance of Rome to be the exemplar of Christian piety to the rest of world

=== Leading By Example

It was very much a top-down approach, where the Church should not only clean things up, but lead by example

=== Francis Stalls Change

Francis I does everything he can to stop it, and manages to stall it for about a decade

(Remember, it's in his best interest to encourage dissent within the Empire)

== Protestants and Catholics Together

=== Regensburg

While the Papal council is trying to get going, moderates from both the Lutheran and Catholic sides meet at Regensburg in 1541 to try yet again to heal the divisions in the Church

=== Agreement of a Sort

While they manage to agree on a complicated wording of the doctrine of justification, they can't agree on any of the other key issues (like the Sacraments, authority to interpret Scripture, etc.)

=== Nothing Left

Historically, Regensburg functions as the point of no return -- after Regensburg, no serious attempt would be made for reconciliation until the 20th Century

=== Regensburg Leads to Trent

The next major Papal council would be the Council of Trent, which would be a major internal reform for the Catholic Church, but it would also drive the wedge even deeper between Catholics and Protestants

=== The Spirit of Regensburg

The spirit of Regensburg is still very much alive and well today

=== Evangelicals and Catholics Together

In 1994 a document between key leaders from both Protestants and Catholics drafted "`Evangelicals and Catholics Together`" (ECT), to wide spread rejoicing and condemnation

=== Evangelicals and Catholics Together Again

In 1998 they created a second document, "`The Gift of Salvation`" (a.k.a., ECT2), that addressed many of the concerns people had risen regarding ECT -- particularly with regard to how we are saved

=== The Gift of Salvation

To give a flavor of what it says:

____
"`We understand that what we here affirm is in agreement with what the Reformation traditions have meant by justification by faith alone (sola fide). ... We must not allow our witness as Christians to be compromised by halfhearted discipleship or needlessly divisive disputes. ...we recognize that there are necessarily interrelated questions that require further and urgent exploration. Among such questions are these: ...diverse understandings of merit, reward, purgatory, and indulgences; Marian devotion and the assistance of the saints in the life of salvation...`"

Good commentary http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9801/articles/cassidy.html[in favor of ECT2] and http://www.alliancenet.org/pub/articles/AppealToEvangelicals.html[against ECT2].
