=== Submit To The Governing Authorities

[.bible]
--
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13:1-2&version=NIV[Romans 13:1-2] -- Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.

=== Do Not Rebel

Both Luther and Calvin insist that we observe the straight-forward meaning of the text: Don't [actively] rebel against those in authority over you

They even give examples from the Bible where people were called to obey clearly evil rulers

=== Minimal Resistence

There is a hierarchy of authority, though, so if you are commanded by the ruler to do something that God explicitly prohibits -- or are prohibited on something God explicitly commands -- then you are called to disobey the magistrate only so far as is absolutely necessary to obey God

Any more than the minimal resistance of the authority than is needed to obey God is a sin; a direct violation of Romans 13 and the 4th (or 5th, depending on how you number them) Commandment

=== Magisterial Exception

As noted before, though, Calvin and Luther do make a small exception for the magistrates themselves

A magistrate, acting as a ruler, can defy his ruler insofar as it enables him to better serve God

So while an individual can not take up arms against his ruler, a lesser ruler may be able to do so against a greater if that's what's needed to carry out his duties as a representative of God

=== Calvanist Calls for Non-Violence

While Calvin repeatedly called for non-violence, he actively participated in stirring up the fervor that would lead to violence -- particularly in the form of iconoclasm

=== Is It Really A Time To Trust "`The System`"?

They were told how the Catholic Church had lead generations of their families -- and even now many of their loved ones -- into idolatry and damnation, but they should just wait for the local magistrates to do something about it

He and his followers railed so fiercely against the idolatry of the Catholics that it was like saying, "`Here's the guy that raped and brutally murdered your entire family, but I don't want you to lay a finger on him. Let the local judge take care of the matter. Oh, and by the way, he's the judge's brother.`"

It didn't sit well with people...

=== Side Note -- Numbering The Commandments

Just a note on the numbering of the Ten Commandments: Catholics and Lutherans combine into the 1st Commandment what the Reformed churches split into the 1st and 2nd ("`Honor God...`" and "`No graven images...`"), while they split what the Reformed churches have for the 10th Commandment (the two forms of coveting)

=== Side Note -- Numbering Confusion (pt1/4)

http://www.wels.net//sab/qa/bible-interp-26.html[Here's the best explanation of the confusion that I've seen]:

____
The Bible says there are ten commandments but never numbers them. Specific numbering of the commandments is not taught in the Bible but is an interpretation of the reader.
____

=== Side Note -- Numbering Confusion (pt2/4)

____
When you read the 10 Commandments in Exodus 20 or Deuteronomy 5, it appears there are only nine commandments. Either you divide the coveting commandment into two to produce ten (this is the Catholic tradition retained by the Lutheran church). Or, you divide the idolatry commandment into two to produce ten. This is the Reformed tradition, which was motivated at least in part by a desire to make a statement against the images of the Catholic church...

=== Side Note -- Numbering Confusion (pt3/4)

____
...It is quite possible that neither of these traditions is correct. It seems unlikely that the coveting commandment is two distinct commandments because the items are not in the same order in the two versions in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5. The 9th Commandment would be different in the two versions if you divide after the first item. Also there does not seem to be a good basis for splitting the 1st Commandment.

=== Side Note -- Numbering Confusion (pt4/4)

____
The solution perhaps lies in noting what the Bible actually says. It does not say there are ten commandments. The Hebrew says there are ten words from God. The NIV retains the term "`Ten Commandments`" though this is not literally correct. It may well be that the first word is not a commandment, but the opening statement, "`I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt.`" This provides the motivation for keeping the nine commandments which follow.
