=== Charles Issues An Ultimatum

In 1531, after the Diet of Augsburg failed to produce the reconciliation between the Lutherans and the Catholics that Charles V so desperately desired, he issued an ultimatum to the Lutherans that they must renounce Protestantism and return to Catholicism

=== The Schmalkaldic League

In response, the Lutheran cities and territories formed the Schmalkaldic League

It is an alliance to defend themselves against the power of the Empire

=== Resisting Oppression

Luther himself underwent a change of perspective, backing down from his insistence that the individual Christian must obey his authorities at all times, or employ only passive disobedience

--
(Obvious examples of passive disobedience would be chapters 3 and 6 of the book of Daniel)
--

He started writing about the necessity of political entities to resist oppression

=== Not Able To Enforce His Threat

Charles V couldn't really respond for another fifteen years because during that time he was constantly fighting France and the Turks (who had various "`arrangements`" with France to help weaken the Emperor's power)

=== The League Gains Allies

In the intervening years, even Henry VIII and Francis I established diplomatic ties with the League

The politics of weakening the Empire's power was more important than that they were dealing with heretics

=== The Schmalkaldic War

Eventually Charles and Francis reach a truce, allowing both to turn their attentions back home to fight religious dissent

In 1546 -- just a few months after Luther's death -- the Schmalkaldic War starts, and Imperial troops defeat the Lutherans in 1547

=== The Augsburg Interim

The Augsburg Interim grants some minor concessions to the Lutheran territories (like married clergy), but otherwise amounts to imposing the reinstatement of Catholicism of the Schmalkaldic League members

While Charles has the military might to defeat the Lutherans, he doesn't have the political power to really enforce the terms of surrender

=== Lutheran Counter-Offensive

In 1552, the Lutherans perform a counter-offensive, leading the Peace of Augsburg in 1558

=== The Peace of Augsburg

The particularly significant thing about the Peace of Augsburg is that it established that each prince can determine for himself what the religion of his territory would be ( _cuius regio, eius religio_ -> "`Whose realm, his religion`")

For the first time, non-Catholic Christians had official legal and political recognition

=== A Very Specific Peace

Note that this wasn't religious toleration in the modern sense: if you're in a Catholic land, you'd better be Catholic, and vice-versa for Lutheran lands

Also, princes had the option of Roman Catholicism or Augsburg Confession Lutheranism -- and none other (such as Calvanist/Zwinglian/Anabaptist)

=== Setting the Stage for More War

That "`oversight`" (not being "`true`" religious toleration) would have disastrous consequences, acting as a spark of the Thirty Years War
