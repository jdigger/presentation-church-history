=== Charles Focusses On His Homeland

Now that Charles V didn't have to worry about fighting France, he could not only turn his attention back to Germany, but also to his homeland, the Low Countries

They had an increasing population of people rejecting Catholicism and embracing Protestantism

Lutheran and Anabaptist teachings were plentiful, but Calvinism was growing the most significantly

He increases the use of the inquisition and puts it under Imperial control

=== Much More Local Help In His Fight

He was able to get a lot more help this time, though, since local authorities had recently been so severely burned by the Peasant's War and the Kingdom of MÃ¼nster

However, it was keeping peace that was the primary focus of the magistrates, so if suppressing the Protestants would cause more disorder instead of less, they generally left them alone

=== France Tries To Extinguish Protestantism

In France, Francis I and then his son Henry II were more successful in bringing official pressure to bear

=== Driven Into the Arms of Calvin

They faced a serious problem, though, in that Calvin was French, and Geneva is right over the border

So the persecution in France would drive French Protestants into Geneva, where they would get a real taste and indoctrination in Calvinism

=== French Blowback

The exiles would burn with a desire to bring the things that they had learned to their loved ones still in France

It caused a backwash of people returning to France -- but this time as zealous missionaries

To make matters even harder on the authorities, the more they'd fight, the more martyrs they'd produce, which would cause the Protestant zeal to flare even brighter
