== The Growth of Calvinism in France

=== Exporting the Reformation

During the 1550's and 1560's, printing became Geneva's largest industry

She exported enormous quantities (by 16th Century standards) of forbidden Protestant (principally Calvinist) literature all over Europe

=== Demand Outpacing Supply

Even with the large numbers of ministers being trained, demand was vastly exceeding supply in places like France

To give a picture of how Calvinism was growing, in 1554 there were no organized Calvinist churches in all of France (the Calvinists there all met secretly in house meetings and the like), but just eight years later there were approximately 750

=== Two Million French Calvinists

Around that time, the number of French Calvinists (known as Huguenots) numbered about two million people -- nearly 10% of the entire French population

// === Geneva Acts as a Communications Hub

// Regardless of size, all such communities were in constant communication with each other all over Europe, with Geneva often acting as a hub

=== The Reformation Is for the Middle Class

Calvinism and Lutheranism (not as much for Anabaptism) drew primarily from the middle-class in the battle for the souls of people

=== Half of French Nobility

Even with the difficulty in recruiting from the top rung of society, by 1560 approximately half of the French nobility had converted

Even though France is still officially Catholic and being a Protestant is illegal, it's become extremely difficult to impose those laws

=== Strength In Numbers

As their numbers increased, Huguenots became increasingly bold

There was open preaching in the streets, to incidents of iconoclasm

The largest display of such boldness was a five night parade in 1558 of three to four thousand Huguenots sang Psalms through the streets of Paris

=== Rejoice, But Keep Order

Calvin, of course, is ecstatic about the spread of the Gospel in France

Remember, though, that his views regarding the state are essentially the same as Luther's

He repeatedly and urgently pleaded with people to make sure that they don't actively resist the government or act violently

=== Death of France's Kings

In 1559, Henry II dies in a jousting match, which causes court factions to flare

As part of the new regime's attempt to hold onto power, attempts to repress the Huguenots are redoubled

This was at exactly the same time that Calvinism is growing explosively and a large portion of those in important positions of power have converted

The following year, Francis II, the new king, also died

=== Catherine de Medici

Charles IX became king, but since he was only ten years old, Catherine de Medici (their mother) became regent

=== Mediating a Truce with the Huguenots

She sees how combustible the current situation is, and tries to mediate a truce

She turns out to be just as effective in doing so as Charles V was at Augsburg

It failed miserably

=== The Edict of Saint-Germain

In an attempt to head-off a civil war, Catherine issued an edict of toleration

Essentially it said that Protestants could worship in private, and any gathers had to be out of cities and towns

=== Proof of Growing Power

It acted as further proof to the Huguenots of their increasing political weight, causing them to be even bolder

Incidents of iconoclasm and other public displays accelerated instead of becoming more moderate

=== Testing the Toleration

The leading Catholic noble in France, the Duke of Guise, came across a worship service of Huguenots in 1562 in a barn

There was question whether the Edit was in effect yet, but the House of Guise had never really recognized it anyway

=== Massacre of Vassy

The Duke tried to break up the service, but when his soldiers tried to go in they were rebuffed

Events escalated, and a stone hit the Duke

Enraged at the attack on his person and honor by the heretics, he ordered his men to set fire to the barn/church

At least 60 Huguenots die as a result, and twice as many are wounded

(In researching this, I found a number of major accounts of this event, which vary from the Duke being a noble and courageous man who had tried to minimize the bloodshed, to a slaughterer of people on their knees in a church. What I stated above is the least partisan version I could find.)

=== Sparking War

When Guise went into cities like Paris, he was received as a hero, finally making a real effort to put an end to heresy

--
Remember that while the Huguenots had gained significant political power, ~90% of France was Catholic
--

This acted as the spark for the First French War of Religion

There would then be 36 years of on-and-off religious wars in France, ultimately leading to the defeat of the Huguenots

(For comparison, the American Civil War was 4 years.)
