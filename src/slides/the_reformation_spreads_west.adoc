== The Reformation Spreads West

=== France

France was much less urbanized than Germany or the Low Countries, which meant that it was much harder for the "`new`" ideas to be spread

Instead, the Reformation in France depended on the patronage of powerful nobles and clergy

=== Guillaume Briçonnet

The most important French reformer was Guillaume Briçonnet, the bishop of Meaux

While Briçonnet was not a follower of Luther, he brought to his diocese the leading French humanist, Jacques Lefèvre d'Etaples

=== Pioneering Sola Fide

Lefèvre, in 1512 (five years before the 95 Theses) had written about _sola fide_ in almost exactly the same formulation as Luther

The big difference was that for Luther it was something to shout from the mountain tops, Lefèvre was a quiet and recluse man who wrote everything in a very scholarly Latin, not meant for "`normal`" people to read

=== Haven for Reform

Briçonnet also brought to his diocese a number of distinctly Lutheran preachers, creating a haven for reform-minded people

Despite the actions of people like Briçonnet, the Church in France also condemned Luther and his followers and applied its weight toward crushing the dissent

=== Committed Humanist Patron

France's king, Francis I, however, was rather vague on his position towards matters

Francis was a committed patron of the humanists (he brought Leonardo Di Vinci, for example, into France for the last three years of his life, in addition to founding the Louvre), so he allowed the humanists a great deal of leeway as long as things were done in a "`proper`" and courtly fashion

=== Humanism But No Reformation

Francis didn't think that humanism equals reformation, and therefore the problems they were having in Germany did not affect France's patronage of humanists

But when Protestants broke those boundaries and became destructive or criticized the Mass, then he came down hard on them

=== French Humanism Is Not German Heresy

Francis was a dedicated Catholic, but he didn't want to destroy French humanism simply because of German heresy

It is only because of Francis' protection that Briçonnet was able to harbor the reformers in Meaux

=== Affair of the Placards

During the night before Sunday October 18, 1534, Zwinglian Protestants had posted broadsheets all over Paris entitled "`True Articles on the Horrible, Enormous and Insufferable Articles of the Papal Mass`"

There couldn't possibly be a more clear attack on the very core of Catholic worship

=== Protestant Ransacking Conspiracy

The scope of the postings and the venom in its words set off rumors everywhere that the Protestants were planning to burn down the churches, sack the Louvre, and massacre all the Catholics

Even worse, there was clearly a huge, planned conspiracy because exactly the same thing had happened in five other cities around Paris

And to really top things off, someone had posted placards inside the very castle that the king was sleeping in

=== Reaction to the Placards

Public and official reaction to this event was extremely swift and powerful

Massive investigations, swift trials and executions were conducted, and public processions were arranged calling for God to free the land of the scourge of the Protestants

=== Heresy Had Come To France

The Affair of the Placards was a tremendous wake-up call for Francis regarding the dangers of allowing the Protestants the freedoms that he had permitted them -- the "`German problem`" had come to France in a big and very visible way

Francis would no longer let the Reformation grow in France, and worked hard with the other authorities to crush it
