== Implementing the Reforms of Trent

=== Taking It On

In order for Trent to have any kind of real power, it needed to be acted upon

Many previous attempts had failed because of half-hearted (or no) implementation, but Trent was taken on with gusto; from the top on down

=== Fixing Catholicism's Image Problem

While most of it had theological/ecclesiastical substance behind it, all of it (including things like increased patronage in the arts) was meant to give Catholicism a good name

The effort was now under way to change Rome's image

* from being oppressive, hypocritical and scattershot
* to being enlightened, pious and unified

=== Popes Implementing Trent

The three popes following Trent -- Pius V, Gregory XIII and Sixtus V -- were instrumental in reforming the life of the church

=== Pope Pius V

Pius V (later Saint Pius V), is known for his heavy-handed and extremely effective clamp down on enforcing of church law, regardless of the station of the offender (including his predecessor)

He is the one that excommunicated Elizabeth I and declared that the one that would remove her from her throne (i.e., assassinate her) would be "`received into heaven in the arms of angels`" for destroying such a great heretic

Politically, it was a huge mistake as its result was principally to drive the English people even tighter into Elizabeth's arms

It also forced Elizabeth, who had tolerated private Catholic worship, to treat it as treason

=== Pope Gregory XIII

Gregory XIII worked to reshape the image of the church from being a place of rules into a place of humble, charitable piety

Gregory XIII is remembered today primarily the Gregorian Calendar, which is what the entire Western world now uses (as opposed to the older Julian Calendar done under Julius Caesar)

At the pleading of English Jesuits, he "`moderated`" Elizabeth's excommunication, allowing for obedience in civil matters until a Godly reagent would take over again

=== Pope Sixtus V

Sixtus V (who only reigned 5 1/2 years) brought needed order to the institutions in the church, making it a well-oiled machine, solving ancient problems with how things were accomplished in the church

He was ruthless in stamping out lawlessness in Rome and its holdings, and in that extremely brief time he brought the Vatican from the brink of bankruptcy, to being as wealthy as it had ever been

He commissioned many major architectural works, though they relied on ruinous taxes and the destruction of antiquities for their building materials

=== Papal Court To Be Exemplars of Virtue

The Papal Court was cleaned up, holding the Pope and his cardinals to much higher moral standards

The series of popes following Trent wanted to make sure that past behavior (and resulting loss of moral & religious authority in the hearts of people) would no longer have any basis

=== Changes in Governance

Committees of cardinals would now be called to handle particular needs in the church, further streamlining the efficiency and effectiveness of the church's bureaucracy

Clear sets of responsibilities and how they were to be carried out were instituted to remove the barriers to getting things done

[.small]
--
This effort was tremendously successful, and it was shortly after this that modern governments began emerging, basing themselves largely on the work done to organize the Catholic Church

=== Change In Papal Perspective

New popes, following after the example set by Gregory XIII, began seeing themselves less as an "`ecclesiastical prince`" and much more as the Church's shepherd

While the regalia and ceremony of the papacy was maintained, popes began leading masses and other spiritual events on a regular basis

This helped change the image of the papacy from one of authoritarian control to being _closer_ to that of a pastor

=== Rome's Christian History Regains Prestige

The Catacombs were rediscovered after roughly a thousand years, showing the legacy of the early Christian martyrs; their bones, inscriptions and artwork

Whereas the Humanists had focused on Rome because of the ancient Romans, the new archeological findings were uncovering the dramatic stories of the Christians that had died for -- and propagated -- their faith

Rome was no longer the city of the Romans where the Vatican happened to be, but instead had a rich history of Christian witnesses back to the time of the Christian Church's birth

== Trent's Shifts In Power

=== Reducing "`Royal Rights`"

While the Church authorities were aggressive in implementing Trent and the other reforms that sprang from it, it met with resistance by many civil authorities

While none of the major Catholic rulers took issue with the doctrinal issues from Trent, they did have concerns where the new structures would impinge upon "`royal rights`"

=== Philip II on Trent

In Spain, for example, Philip II didn't like the increased centralized control Rome would exert, with less "`outside interference`"

He was used to having people at councils of bishops to make sure that they wouldn't say or do anything that would intrude on his rights as sovereign

=== "`Too Important`"

Catholic to the core (remember his previous statement regarding the move of the Low Countries toward Protestantism), he felt that -- in his words -- "`religion is too important to be left to the Pope`"

=== Implemented With Caveat

So while he officially adopted the Tridentine reforms almost right away, he left himself a huge loophole saying that he was only doing so insofar as it did not restrict royal privilege

=== French Resistance To Trent

In France as well, there had long been a tradition of royal prerogatives that would be swept away with Trent, such as the appointment of bishops

The Vatican knew it had to step cautiously, because the idea was being floated through the French court that they may do the same thing as England (i.e., effectively declaring the king to be the Pope)

=== Bad Timing for France

Trent let out during the early years of the French Wars of Religion

Implementing Trent would limit the control the crown felt it needed over the church during a time of religious war

The strong anti-Protestant language in the Tridentine documents would have been like throwing gas on the fire

Because of that, the French bishops didn't officially recognize Trent until 1615 -- over 50 years after Trent concluded -- and the Crown **_never_** officially accepted it

=== Looking To the Bishops

As noted before, it was the bishops that were the "`point-men`" for actually implementing the reforms, for good or ill

Some bishops took the injunctions by Trent fully to heart and were zealous to implement them, and in those dioceses the reforms were deep and widespread

Others rather liked the "`flexible`" responsibilities and moral standards of "`the old ways`" and were therefore much more reluctant to "`fix`" something they didn't think was broken

=== Post-Trent Priests

Previously, there very often was little that separated priests from the laity, except they had special privileges

They often weren't any better educated, and their behavior was sometimes even worse than their parishioners because they knew they could get away with it

Priests post-Trent are of an entirely new breed

=== Priestly Education

Priests were required to go to seminary, and the educational standards were seriously tightened

In addition to religious and catechismal training, they would learn proper counseling, how to deliver a good sermon, etc.

=== Priests Set Apart

They were to dress differently and be celibate -- all to further emphasize their difference and place in the hierarchy as those that administer the Sacraments and shepherd their flock

=== Seminary Exceptions

The seminary "`requirement`" was a little slippery at first for practical reasons: there were very few seminaries before, so until they could be established (which could take many decades in regions with anti-Trent bishops) as a practical matter exceptions were made

Over time those exceptions would die out

=== Rise of the Jesuits

Now being European didn't automatically mean you're Catholic

That meant that Rome needed to **_compete_** with the Protestants for the souls of people

The new emphasis on having an educated clergy and laity meant that those that specialized in evangelism and education would become vital

The Society of Jesus thus flourished

=== Jesuit Influence

The Jesuits excelled in every discipline, not just religious: literature, philosophy, applied science, politics, etc.

Their education made them coveted political advisors, even for Protestant rulers: a post that the Jesuits often accepted because from there they were much more effective in bringing the ruler back into the Catholic fold

And their plays and other works of art would interweave religious and moral teachings with a good story, furthering their agenda of Catholic education "`through the back door`"

=== The Church Refined

Rome would no longer be an embattled dinosaur

After being forced to take stock and "`remaking`" herself, the Church (Catholic and Protestant) would be a vibrant beacon of piety, maintaining and celebrating her ties with the past while learning many of the lessons that the Reformation and the Renaissance had brought

=== Fortifying for the Enlightenment

The Church emerged from the fire stronger and larger (due to very aggressive missionary work) than ever -- something she would desperately need in order to survive the Enlightenment
