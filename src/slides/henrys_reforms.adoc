=== "`The Defender of the Faith`" Fights the Protestants and Rome

During the mid-1530's things looked rather good for the Protestants, who carefully tried to push England further and further from Catholicism

=== Inventory of Church Properties

In 1536, Thomas Cromwell performed a quick inventory of the property held by the religious orders

All of the small ones are seized by the crown

The monks and nuns could either join the larger monasteries or receive a small stipend from the king

=== Crushing Dissent About the Monasteries

This caused a popular revolt, which was strongly suppressed, and caused the king to become even harsher in his efforts against the monasteries

=== All Monastic Properties Now Belong to the Crown

Between 1538 and 1340, Henry ordered the closing of every monastery throughout his kingdom and take all of their holdings

The addition of the monastic properties more than tripled royal land holdings

--
It was clearly motivated primarily by the desire to have the monastic lands; much of which he then sold to pay for his wars abroad

=== St. Thomas Becket

In 1538 Henry then destroyed the shrine to St. Thomas Becket, one of England's greatest saint, which had served as a pilgrimage location since the 12th Century

--
(Becket's shrine was the destination of the pilgrims in Chaucer's "`The Canterbury Tales`")
--

The problem with people revering Becket was that Becket had been named a saint for his steadfast resistance to royal control over the church

That was not the kind of person Henry wanted people revering

=== Destroying the Cult of the Saints

To the delight of the Protestants, he also destroyed other shrines and tried to get rid of the "`cult of the saints`" in the church

=== Henry As Head of the Church

Anybody that did not deny the Pope and affirm Henry's position as the head of the Church -- and therefore having the right to do all of this -- was executed as a traitor, including Thomas Moore (later canonized as a saint)

--
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060665/[A Man for All Seasons], which won six Academy Awards including Best Picture, was about Thomas More's loyalty to the Church leading to his execution
--

The abbots and the rest that died resisting were declared Catholic martyrs

=== Henry's Bibles

Cromwell had the Bible translated into English (known as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Bible[the Great Bible of 1539]) and officially put in the churches with iconography in the front of the Bibles of Henry in the style of the Old Testament kings

=== Great Bible vs Tyndale Bible

It was a sharp contrast to the suppression of the Tyndale Bible just a decade earlier (and was mostly made from Tyndale's Bible, with "`suitable`" edits)

It served Henry's purpose of getting Bibles in front of his subjects that would reinforce their perception of him as a priest-king

=== The Great Bible as Protestant Subversion

It served the Protestants`' goals because it further drove the wedge between England and Rome

They also knew that wherever people could read the Bible for themselves, Protestantism was likely to grow

=== Cramer Filling the Ranks

They also made sure that open church positions of power were manned with people that were not only anti-papal, as Henry wanted, but also secretly Protestant

=== The Six Articles Act

Late in 1538 Henry starts to realize what is happening and, in 1539, reacts strongly by forcing Parliament to pass the Six Articles Act

The articles affirmed (under penalty of death):

.  Transubstantiation
.  Communion with body alone (i.e., the laity should not receive the blood)
.  Clerical vows of chastity
.  Legitimacy of the traditional Catholic votive mass
.  Necessity of clerical celibacy (i.e., priests must not marry)
.  Maintaining the sacrament of Confession

=== The Protestant "`Party`" Is Over

Cramer was forced to flee for the continent, and Cromwell was tried, convicted and executed as a heretic

Anne had been executed by Henry in 1536 for the crime of giving birth to Elizabeth instead of a son

=== Not A Catholic King Either

As if to really illustrate what the king was doing, on June 30th, 1540, in London he executed three Catholics for treason and three Protestants for heresy

He was neither a Protestant fighting the Catholics, or a Catholic fighting the Protestants

He is Henry VIII, King of England and Head of the Church in England
