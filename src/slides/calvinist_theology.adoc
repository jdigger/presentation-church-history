== Calvinist Theology

=== The Institutes

In 1536, Calvin published the first edition of his most famous work, "`The Institutes of Christian Religion`" (otherwise known simply as "`The Institutes`"), written in Latin

It's a very thorough systematic statement of Christian doctrine

=== Clear and Consistent

While he would continue to expand on it all his life in subsequent editions (which would also be done in French), his basic teachings never change

=== Not Destructive To Social Order

The preface to the first edition of The Institutes was addressed to King Francis I of France, and asked him not to persecute Protestants in the wake of the Affair of the Placards, nor to confuse them with the revolutionaries in Münster

One of the purposes of The Institutes was to clearly show that Protestantism is not destructive to the social order

=== Lenses On the Bible

Lutheran theology tends to focus on Law and Gospel

Calvinist theology tends to focus on God's Sovereignty and Covenants

Law and Gospel supports and highlights God's Sovereignty and Covenants, but approaches it from a different direction

God's Sovereignty and Covenants supports and highlights Law and Gospel, but approaches it from a different direction

=== The Law

Calvin's law background is just as obvious in Calvin as it is in Luther, though it manifests itself in slightly different ways

While Luther saw the Law of God primarily for its use in restraining the sinner and driving him to repentance, Calvin spoke heavily of the role it plays in the believer's life

=== Threefold Use Of the Law

According to Calvin, the Law has three basic purposes:

* a mirror
* a curb/restraint
* a guide

=== Law As A Mirror

Briefly, the "`mirror`" aspect is where, as sinners, we are shown our corruption

As saints following the Law, it reflects to the world the God we are called to be examples of

=== Law As Restraint

It helps keep us from breaking the negative aspects of God's Law ("`Thou shall not...`") by acting as a curb, including as a restraint on the ungodly

Even when they break it, the very fact that there is a Law helps restrain the extent of what is done

=== Law As Guide

It guides us in keeping the positives aspects of the Law ("`Thou shall...`") and knowing how to please God

Its role is in sanctification, not condemnation

=== Duty To God

Another place where Calvin's background is plain in his writings and theology is in the numerous times that Calvin's "`duty`" before God interacted in his life

=== Luther on Duty To God

While Luther would talk about the commands of God, he shied away from such language, stressing that what we do should be done entirely out of love and thankfulness rather than because we "`ought`" to do so

=== The King of Kings

Calvin was not nearly as hesitant about talking in terms of "`duty to God`"

We are called to obey the King of Kings, and the Bible makes no bones about it, so why should we?

That said, of course, the only thing that's truly pleasing to God is that which we do out of love for Him

=== The Role of Duty

Like as Peter's "`Lord I believe, help my unbelief,`" duty is there to push you through when your heart's not up for the task

Or, to put it the way that C.S. Lewis did:

[quote, "Letters to Children"]
____
A perfect man wd. never act from a sense of duty; he’d always want the right thing more than the wrong one. Duty is only a substitute for love (of God and of other people), like a crutch, which is a substitute for a leg. Most of us need the crutch at times; but of course it’s idiotic to use the crutch when our own legs (or own loves, tastes, habits etc) can do the journey on their own!

== Calvin On Election and Justification

image::between_heaven_and_hell_by_sabin_boykinov-d31yxx7.jpg[alt="http://sabin-boykinov.deviantart.com/art/Between-Heaven-and-Hell-184708411"]

=== Election Comfort

The doctrines of Election and Justification are not only sources of great comfort for Calvin, as with Luther, but it also produce a strong sense of God's sovereignty

God is declaring that we would be called out of the damned human race to be His own, and He declares us innocent of our sins

=== God's Sovereignty

Take that along with other obvious things like the creation of the universe and the resurrection of the dead, and it couldn't be clearer that what God wants, He gets

He is worthy of all glory, majesty and praise

Calvin hones in on this point more than previous theologians, which leads him into waters that others, like Luther, were unwilling to go

=== The Love of Our Sovereign Redeemer

Through all the talk of power he focussed on the unimaginable love, power and mercy of our Redeemer God

=== Out Gracious Redeemer

A prime example would be the famous sermon from an American Calvinist, Jonathan Edwards`' "`Sinners In the Hands of an Angry God`"

Edwards spends far more time talking about the exquisite love, beauty, mercy, and grace of God than His wrath

It is precisely because of how much we deserve His wrath and desperately need His mercy that the horror of Christ's sacrifice and the love that God has shown us is such a big deal!

=== God Is In Control

Calvin's sense of Divine Providence is much stronger than Luther's, because of his focus on the sovereignty of God

Nothing happens that is not totally within the will and control of God

That we don't understand how the death of children and other tragedies work into the grand scheme of things is irrelevant compared to trusting that He does

=== Trusting God

* That the Apocalypse should come today or a million years from now is not our concern
* That believers are persecuted for their faith is not our concern other than to try to help them in their need
* That children are dying is not our concern except to provide comfort

Our concern is to be faithful to the calling that He has given us, and leave the rest to Him

=== God's Will

God's will **_can not_** be frustrated

It is Calvin's view of Providence and God's absolute sovereignty that that leads to his most controversial doctrine: double predestination

Because God's will is absolute, nothing happens that He does not at least tacitly command, which includes not only the salvation of those that He elects, but also the damnation of those He does not (known as the "`reprobate`")

=== "`Esau I have hated`"

He said that not only does this make logical sense, but that's secondary to the fact that the Bible clearly states it in https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+9%3A13-23&version=NIV[Romans 9:13-23], with other (though less clear) references all over the Bible

It makes no difference that God makes such decisions regardless of our choices or actions -- God is God, and we are not (See https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2040-41&version=NIV[Job 40-41])

=== No Point To Worry

Since God's will is absolute, there's no point in worrying, "`Am I saved or not?`"

If you are, you are; if you're not, you're not

=== God Assures Your Salvation

Passages like John 10:28-29 and Philippians 1:6 show that this means that you do not have to worry about your salvation

Once God has brought you to faith, your salvation is assured

=== God Will Preserve His Saints

There are two extreme ways to take this doctrine of the Preservation of the Saints (known popularly as "`Once saved, always saved`")

Both have been common ever since Calvin, even though he explicitly warned against both:

* worry that I'm not among the Elect
* disregarding the Law

=== Am I Among the Elect?

You can worry so much that "`maybe I'm not one of the elect`" that you loose the joy of your salvation

This extreme is common among the "`hyper-Calvinists`" like the Puritans

It can cause you to work so hard trying to prove to yourself and others that you are among the Elect that _Sola Fide_ is lost

A related perversion is to figure, "`Well, God must not have elected me, so I might as well sin all I want since there's no way I could possibly go to Heaven anyway`"

=== Once Saved Always Saved

The other is to figure that since I've made a confession that Jesus is my savior and therefore saved, I can now do anything I want since I'm going to Heaven anyway

Of course this totally ignores the warnings in Hebrews 4:1, Philippians 2:12, and others

=== Boldly Living for Christ

For Calvin, this brings Luther's argument that not having to work your way into Heaven means that you'll actually do far more good works up to a whole new level

Because you can be **completely assured** in the security of your salvation and that God's good and gracious will can not be compromised, it should make you that much bolder in living a holy life to His glory

The fruits of faith can not help but manifest themselves due to the total lack of fear

=== Can A Christian Be Timid?

A famous Luther quote is, "`If you're going to sin, sin boldly`"

He obviously wasn't encouraging sin, but instead that we should act as if we actually believed that God will "`make all things work for the good of those who love him and are called according to His purpose.`" [Romans 8:28]

We are constantly told to be humble and to be bold

For him as well as Calvin, a "`timid Christian`" was an oxymoron



== Calvin On the Sacraments

image::baptism---lords-supper-generic.jpg[]

=== Calvin on Baptism (pt1/2)

Baptism doesn't infuse grace or carry any other kind of "`magical`" power, but rather

[quote, "The Institutes, chapters 15, 16"]
____
Baptism is a sign of cleansing, that our sins have been completely wiped out and God will not refer to them again... Those who see baptism only as confession of our faith have missed the main point. Baptism is tied to the promise of the forgiveness... Nor does [Paul] mean that baptism is the cause of salvation; only that certainty of it is received through the sacrament... We must realize that whenever we are baptized we are washed and purified for the whole of life. Each time we sin we must remember that we were baptized for the forgiveness of sins. The purity of Christ is always effective and cannot be wiped out by our failure...
____

=== Calvin on Baptism (pt2/2)

[quote, "The Institutes, chapters 15, 16"]
____
"`[In the church] [children] are to be sealed with the symbol of mercy and so the confidence of the parents is strengthened as they see with their own eyes the covenant of the Lord physically imparted to their children. The children themselves derive direct benefit from their baptism when they are received into the Church and so become the greater interest to the other members. Also, when they grow up they are spurred on to serve God, who has already received them by the formal signal of adoption. We must take very seriously God's condemnation of those who despise the covenant symbol (Gen 17:14). It is a rejection of offered grace.`"
____

=== Calvin's Baptism Similar to Catholic/Lutheran View

It is entirely one-directional: from God to man

As such, it's entirely appropriate to baptize children, as it's a way that God grants blessings to His people

=== Calvin's Baptism Different to Catholic/Lutheran View

It does not create faith in the child or guarantee that the child is a Christian

This is one of those places where you can really see how various doctrines interact, particularly _Sola Fide_ and _Perseverance of the Saints_, in this particular case

=== Calvin's Baptism Compared to Anabaptist/Baptist View

Like Anabaptists and Baptists, Calvin does't believe in the "`magical`" powers of Baptism to create faith

Unlike them, Calvin insists that it's **FAR** more than a confession of faith, but a covenantal seal upon that person carrying a host of promises of His grace


=== Calvin on the Lord's Support (pt1/3)

[quote, "The Institutes, chapter 17"]
____
The sacrament of communion bears witness to [Christ's redemptive work], enabling us to understand that they are revealed to us as surely as if Christ was physically present with us, to be seen and touched. These are words which can never lie nor deceive -- Take, eat and drink. ...  In telling us to take, he makes it clear it is ours. In telling us to eat, he makes it clear that it becomes part of us. In stating that his body was given and his blood poured out ... for our salvation...  The distribution of the elements would be meaningless if his body and blood has not been given for redemption.
____


=== Calvin on the Lord's Support (pt2/3)

[quote, "The Institutes, chapter 17"]
____
So they are represented by bread and wine, to indicate that they are intended to nourish our spiritual life... The chief object of the sacrament is to seal and confirm his promise by which he testified that his flesh is our food and his blood our drink, feeding us to eternal life... Those who believe that Christ's flesh is not present unless it is in the bread are greatly mistaken. They do not allow for the secret working of the spirit, which unites Christ himself to us. Christ does not seem to them to be present unless he descends to us, although we can just as well come into his presence when he raises us to himself.
____

=== Calvin on the Lord's Support (pt3/3)

[quote, "The Institutes, chapter 17"]
____
The quibble is over the process: they place Christ in the bread while we consider it wrong to bring him down from heaven. You must judge for yourself. But never subscribe to the falsehood that Christ is not present in the Supper if he is not secreted under a covering of bread. We speak of a heavenly mystery and it is not necessary to bring Christ down to earth for us to be united with him.
____

=== Calvin's Lord's Supper Similar to Catholic/Lutheran View

It is similar to Catholic and Lutheran doctrines of Baptism in that it's entirely one-directional: from God to man

It's a very tangible way that God both reconfirms and strengthens the faith of the participants

=== Calvin's Lord's Supper Different to Catholic/Lutheran View

The principle difference is that no corporal flesh or blood is consumed in the bread and wine

To restate Calvin: Does Christ descend to us in the Supper, or lift us to Him?

=== Calvin's Lord's Supper Compared To Anabaptist/Baptist View

Anabaptists and Baptists also don't believe that the bread and wine physically change

While they believe the sacrament doesn't carry mystical powers any greater than any other memorial or occasion where the Word is present, Calvin vehemently denies that


== Calvinist Shorthand

image::tulip1.jpg[alt="https://lumenveritatisacademy.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/john-calvin/"]

=== Remembering the Distinctions

The central tenets that distinguish Calvinism from most other doctrines are summarized in the acronym T.U.L.I.P.

=== Total Depravity

Sin is in every part of one's being, including the mind and will, so that a person cannot save himself

We are **dead** in our sins, not merely "`sick`"

=== Unconditional Election

God chooses to save people unconditionally; we are not chosen on the basis of our own merit

There is nothing good in us without Christ

=== Limited Atonement

The sacrifice of Christ on the cross was for the purpose of saving the elect only, not the reprobate as well

While Christ's atonement was infinite in power, it is limited in the scope of who it is applied to

Said another way: If God "`applies`" or "`redeems`" His salvation to a human soul, that soul is now His

=== Irresistible Grace

When God has chosen to save someone, He will

Who can override God's sovereign will?

He over-rides our natural hatred of Him, turning our hearts of stone into hearts of flesh

=== Perseverance of the Saints

Those people God chooses cannot lose their salvation; they will continue to believe

If they fall away, it will be only for a time

The flip-side is that anyone that is not ultimately saved were not chosen by God and were never in a state of saving grace


== Calvin On Government

image::ReformationWallGeneva21.jpg[]

=== Supporting a Godly Life

While only God can save a person, as humans we can do a great deal to hinder the work of the Holy Spirit

Similarly, we should strive to not put any obstacles in the way of God manifesting Himself in the good works and holy living of the believer

=== Letting the Spirit Work

We should do all we can to create an environment conducive to letting the Spirit "`do His thing`"

This implies that there should be institutions, laws and discipline that support that effort

=== Ecclesiastical Ordinances of Geneva

Shortly upon arriving again in Geneva, Calvin drafted "`The Ecclesiastical Ordinances of the Church of Geneva,`" and they were quickly adopted by the city's council

=== Geneva's Four Ecclesiastical Offices

Using Paul's letters (particularly Ephesians and 1 Timothy), four distinct offices were prescribed:

* **Pastors** are responsible for preaching the Word and administering the sacraments.  These men have to pass a doctrinal exam, be of exceptional conduct, and be accepted by their peers and the people before they can be ordained.

* **Teachers** (or "`doctors`") are to be able to teach sound doctrine and do proper scholarship to ensure that God's Word receives the care that it deserves.  That, of course, included that he be able to read the Bible in the languages that it was written.

* The 12 **Elders** are laymen called to work with the pastor to supervise the morals of the people under them and provide proper discipline/encouragement. The principle qualifications for the office are impeccable character and great wisdom

* **Deacons** are laymen (or laywomen in the case of deaconesses) charged with seeing to the earthly needs of the church. They oversee the running of the church's business, visit the sick, provide for food and clothing for the poor, etc.

=== Christian Discipline in Geneva

The Consistory in Geneva was a body made up of the pastors and the elders to form an ecclesiastical "`court`" designed to help maintain proper Christian discipline

They met every week to discuss infractions, and they were very careful to make sure that there was absolutely no difference in their judgments between the weak and the powerful

Disciplinary actions varied from private rebukes, to public repentance, to referrals to the civic magistrates

The kinds of things they concerned themselves with included: non-attendance of church, improper conduct during worship, performing superstitious (i.e., Catholic) rituals, and being unruly (e.g., drunkenness, dancing, wife beating)

=== Producing a Well-Run Christian Commonwealth

The church and the state had clearly separate duties, but they shared the same immediate goal: to produce a well-run Christian commonwealth that reflects God's glory

A sanctified Christian is a good citizen, and vice-versa

=== Genevan Leadership

The way that this working hand-in-hand played out in practice was that the elders were largely drawn from members of the town council, and religious leaders -- who had absolutely no official political power -- were able to influence the magistrates by moral authority

In other words, when Calvin spoke, people listened...
