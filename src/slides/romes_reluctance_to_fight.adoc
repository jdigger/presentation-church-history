=== Overwhelming Volume

The shear volume of pro-Protestant literature during the early part of the Reformation is over five times as much as what Catholic Church and her supporters published

=== Taking It To the People

While there were long and technical treatises done by the Protestants, most of what they did was short, easy to understand, and in the "`common`" tongue instead of the scholarly Latin

=== Taking It To the Learned

Catholic responses, on the other hand, were almost always long, very carefully reasoned, very deep theologically and generally in Latin

As we saw before, Catholics would also use "`sound bites,`" but they were no where near the numbers of what the Protestants did

=== Far More Experience

The Catholic Church had many times the resources available to the Protestants, and was much more organized

Rome had over a thousand years of experience in fighting heresy -- why didn't it wage a more aggressive counter-propaganda campaign?

=== The Common Man

When we were looking at Communicating the Reformation, we saw that the Reformers very often specifically targeted the "`common man`"

The Catholics -- repeatedly burned by prior experience -- tried very hard to keep the "`common man`" out of the dispute as much as possible

=== Simple But Not Easy

While parts of the Christian faith are very, very simple, parts of it can get very, very complicated

Those parts that are easy enough for a little child can get brutally difficult to understand once you go much beyond the surface -- which is much of what was being debated between the Catholic and Protestant theologians

=== Lack of Discipling

If you aren't careful, it's very easy to go way off track, deep into heresy

Uneducated people generally don't have the theological discipline to make sure that all of their doctrines line-up

Do you really want to risk people's eternal souls because they think they have a clue from sound-bites?

=== Authoritative Condemnation

Luther and his teachings were officially condemned by the Catholic Church fairly early on (in 1520)

Any further action by Rome would be "`dignifying`" Luther & co. with a response, as if the condemnation weren't really authoritative

=== The Last Word

Argument with a heretic comes when you suspect that they are merely in error, but once they have shown themselves to be obstinate you simply leave him be

Besides, it's not like the issues were still undecided: Rome had spoken, saying the Reformers were wrong, so what else was left to say?

Continuing would imply that Rome wasn't the last word on theological matters

=== Biblical Calls To Ignore Obstinate Heretics

There are many places where the Bible calls for ignoring people who simply won't give up their errors, such as a great deal of Proverbs (esp. https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+20%3A3&version=NIV[20:3], https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+23%3A9&version=NIV[23:9] and https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+26%3A4&version=NIV[26:4]) and https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+6%3A11&version=NIV[Mark 6:11]

=== Pearls Before Swine

With a few exceptions, Catholic authorities simply didn't want to fight the Protestants with counter-arguments, debates, etc. https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A6&version=NIV[because it was not a battle that should be fought at all (Matthew 7:6)]

Once Luther and his teachings were condemned, it then became a political matter of quieting a heretic, not something that the Catholic Church should deal with theologically
