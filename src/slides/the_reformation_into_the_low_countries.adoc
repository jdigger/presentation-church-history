== The Reformation Spreads North into the Low Countries

=== Softened Ground

In the Low Countries (modern day Belgium and Netherlands), there were a number of things that favored the spread of the Reformation into the country, such as

* its relatively high percentage of urbanized and literate citizens
* a strong tradition of humanism (Erasmus, for example, was from Holland)
* there were a lot of Observant Augustinian orders -- with a number of monks that had spent time with Luther in Wittenberg -- are in the area

=== Not So Easy

Despite such things, though, the Reformation couldn't really get started in the Low Countries

=== Homeland of the Emperor

The primary reason is that, unlike the relative autonomy that Germany had, the Low Countries were directly under the control of the Holy Roman Empire with relatively weak nobility (unlike Luther's prince, Fredrick of Saxony), and Charles V clamped down on dissent quickly

Charles was also a native of Ghent (in modern Belgium), and thus particularly concerned with making sure that his homeland stay Catholic

It was also very prosperous, acting as a primary source of the Empire's income...

=== Magisterial Support

Unlike in Germany, where the magistrates are reluctant to enforce the condemnations against the Reformation, there were no such reservations in the Low Countries

Universities and churches announced official denunciations of Luther (and Erasmus), including state-sponsored book burnings

=== The First Martyrs of the Reformation

Secular and ecclesiastical leaders that had been leaning toward the Reformation were forced to recant, and the Augustinian monastery in Antwerp was dissolved as a hot-bed of heresy

Sixteen of the monks are forced to recant their views, while two refuse to do so

After more attempts to get them to recant, they are executed as obstinate heretics in Brussels in July of 1523

They were immediately hailed in Germany as the first martyrs of the Reformation

=== Blowback from the Low Countries

The suppression couldn't kill the Reformation in the Low Countries, however

It went underground and began to build in force, to the point that when it finally broke forth in full power, it had much more explosive effects than it did in Germany
